0,"We were hit with the warning that we needed to upgrade to premier, which surprised us.  I had read the negative reviews but assumed that we didn't need what appeared to be business related tax forms.  However, we have mineral rights that caused the deluxe version hiccup and require the upgrade.  Fortunately, it was a free upgrade for us.

The product itself seems to work as well as in past years, and I have no complaints about thst.

Unfortunately, in the future it will probably force us to use a different product because the cost difference of premier vs deluxe will more than likely be higher than the pitiful royalties we receive.  I'm also greatly concerned about our security using Turbotax given all the filing fraud this year.  Going forward my decision on tax software will be based on security and features, not on established brand.  Hopefully, Intuit will fix the issues and make the right decisions on what is included in the deluxe version in the future."
0,"I understand that there is a tendency to continue producing what a company thinks work. Learning a new language or brushing up on your existing skill is tricky business. I learned a lot of Japanese learning in Japan, but it's not always possible to just go to a country to cement or start your language skills so I picked up the Spanish version. The largest problem I am having the the Instant Immersion series (in general) is they don't seem to update anything. I've used the Japanese version in the past, and got ahold of this Spanish version. The graphics are dated and unattractive. The videos/animation slow and not fluid. This looks like they took the same product they've been peddling for years and updated the installation programs and little else which is unfortunate. I understand a product like this wants to be low profile so it can install on even the oldest computers still running (and many of those old computers are still more than enough for average users), but I just find this method cheap and unappealing. That sounds are still hollow sounding as well and modern day clip-art looks more attractive. The games/learning tools are the same but not expanded. It doesn't look like they added new words or addressed much new material at all.

I still think these are interesting to start with if you don't have an old version. If you do have an old version and can get it to function properly on your current build, pass on these. There just isn't enough new here to justify buying it again."
1,"I already have the Spanish version of Rosetta Stone, but we are planning a trip to Italy (hopefully) this fall, so I jumped on a recent offer to try out the Italian version, too. (Please see my review of the Spanish version, as well.)

I find the software incredibly intuitive to learn and use, and while there's a LOT of review, it definitely drums things into your head. I also like the diversity used in the photos -- OK, sometimes it's a little surprising to have a picture of a man who's clearly Central Asian when you're in the middle of your Italian lesson, but people from all ethnicities speak all different languages in this jet-setting world, so I guess it really shouldn't seem all that unusual!

One relatively minor complaint: Both my husband and I have had some issues with the headset. Sometimes we've found ourselves shouting into it in Italian, trying to get it to pick up our words. Other times, we're positive that we're pronouncing the words correctly, but it doesn't think we are. The one that came with my Spanish set seems to work better than the one that came with the Italian set, for some reason. Considering the cost of the program, a more reliable headset would be nice.

A word about the audio companions -- they're very handy, but they will NOT work on their own. We find them useful mostly for when we're driving and want to practice a bit. I particularly like to use them to keep me from forgetting what I've learned when I haven't had a chance to use the software for a little while."
1,"This is my fourth year using TurboTax Home & Business. I love it. When I first started using it, I found I could use it to fill out city tax form. All the forms I have needed are supplied by TurboTax. It's cheaper than paying a tax preparer. I used an accountant to do my taxes the first year I went into business. I wanted to deduct something that he wouldn't deduct and he deducted something I didn't approve. I didn't realize it until after I filed. He charged me $500. Had I done it myself with TurboTax I could have received a much larger refund and could have saved on the cost of doing my taxes. I think TurboTax is Awesome."
0.5,"At nearly 2.7 GB, this is probably the biggest program I have ever installed. It attempts to be an all-in-one for everything from photo and video editing to managing your music collection and copy-disk abilities.
It actually pulls it off fairly well. While the photo and video editing software do not compare to the Photoshop elements or Premiers Elements, they are pretty decent and for making home movies and the like it is just fine.
The photo editing offers 3D conversion and can create 3D photos from non 3D images and it works. It also offer many other features available on other similar photo-editing software.
The video editing works well, it is not as polished and cosmetically as pleasing as Premier Elements but it does work well, and while making two 30 minute videos, it did not freeze or crash. However, I am using a Surface Pro 3.....Lesser equipped, older or barebones laptops will have trouble with video editing. Note, the packaging recommends 2 GB minimum ram, but for video editing, I suggest at least 4 GB.
It is also handy to convert video, I have re-sized a few clips for emailing and putting on Facebook etc. it works as well as the freebie programs.
The ability to rip a CD is handy (though something I don't do as much anymore because I typically download my music purchases...thus no need to rip)
The drawback is that it is such a huge program and I am thinking of re-installing it without some of the features to slim it down.
You could argue that to instal multiple software programs or Apps that does all that this does would use up the same amount of memory, and that's a good point, however, I do not plan to uninstall my copy of Photoshop Elements any time soon, and could do without the audio parts of the installation. Meantime, I plan to keep it as is.
The Bottom Line..........
This is a really good option for someone that does not have any other photo, video or sharing software installed, it works well on everything it does, but none of its endeavors are ""best-in-class"" but honestly, will suffice for all but the pickiest folks who look for the best at any cost.
If you have trouble with freezing or crashing, it may well be your hardware that is not up to scratch, especially for video editing, which needs to move huge amounts of data to accomplish its tasks, older hardware or lack of memory and low end graphics abilities just won't cut it so please bear this in mind......"
0.5,"Windows Vista has to be one of the most reviled versions of Windows, right up there with Bob and Windows Me.

The first release of Vista probably deserved some of the criticism, but so did those who tried to install it on older machines that just weren't up to the task. Microsoft probably set expectations a little too high, and as what happened with the first Star Wars prequel, the end product was never going to live up to the expectations.

I did not have any experience with Vista until after the release of SP1, so I might have been spared some ugliness that came out of the gates. Since this review is for the SP1 version, I can safely say that you won't experience the pain and agony that was felt by some of those early adopters, IF you install it on decent hardware.

Don't install a current operating system on hardware that was made years before the release of the operating system. Don't install an OS like Vista on a machine that is choked for RAM or hard drive space.

The box says that it recommends a 1 GHz or faster processor, but I wouldn't install it on anything slower than a 3 GHz Pentium 4. It also says that 1GB of RAM is fine. I would say that's a minimum, and anyone doing multiple tasks should be looking at 2GB as a minimum. (You'll need to get the 64-bit version to use anything past 3GB)

Lastly, don't install this OS on a system drive that has meager transfer rates. Something with a minimum average of 50MB/s will probably do just fine, but the faster the better, of course.

You can't buy a Porsche, put no name tires on it, and fill it with 85 octane gas, and expect decent performance. Likewise, don't install a newer operating system on hardware that is years behind the OS in technology. XP is a great OS for older machines. It will run on a P3-450 with a half GB of RAM without any trouble (so long as you're not installing the latest and greatest software that expects more recent hardware).

The bottom line is to use the right tool for the job. Vista SP1 on a decent machine that was new at the time Vista was released is not going to present issues. I wouldn't install it on a low-powered machine, because doing so is just asking for disappointment and frustration."
1,"...and all I can base my review on is my own experience with the product. Yes, I know others had issues related to what schedules they needed, whether they used the 2013 version and the balky response from Intuit.  No review of this version of TurboTax should ignore the extended dust-up at the start of the the 2014 tax return season, when Intuit took a lot of negative press (totally deserved). This is version of TurboTax bore the brunt of that on these pages and in the consumer software media. This was primarily not because of its functionality, but because of the perhaps not-so-obvious-to-customers changes in what schedules were included in this version of TurboTax for 2014 (fewer than in 2013...to the surprise of many purchasers who found these schedules missing).

Three comments about this events:
(1) My tax situation did not expose me to these issues.
(2) Intuit implemented the change in version/pricing structure badly, and further bungled its response (in at least three different ways that I can count).
(3) Yes: had I not received the same functionality that I'd enjoyed the year before, I would have be in the chorus of 1-star reviews for this product and would and bailed for alternative tax software. Since I wasn't, all I can report is how this version --which met my tax filing needs out of the box-- worked for me.

And, I'm happy to report, it worked great.

I've been using TurboTax for a generation, and this year's worked just fine. Installation and updates following the install (on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines) have been totally problem free for both federal and two state packages.

After installation, TurboTax recognized the most significant of my prior years' information already in the computer. Both federal and state returns were therefore pre-populated with much of the employer, financial institution and payment data that I would have otherwise had to enter by hand.

I have a relatively simple tax situation am lucky enough to have my deductions in equilibrium. It took about three hours start to finish for TurboTax to complete and efile my federal refund and prepare for tax-day mailing of my state payment.

No hiccups, good error trapping and headache free tax preparation. Modest efforts to upsell other services are present, but are easily declined.

I understand that many Intuit users were upset. They can vote with their feet, and I get it.

However, it performed well for me, continuing to take the sting out of the onerous administration of tax returns. While Intuit deserves what it got from both customers and the media, remember this: the true pain of tax time comes from the governments that collect them and frame your liabilities (for all of earning, savings and spending) and NOT from Intuit).

If you're a tax-time procrastinator: April is right around the corner. Now is the time to select with confidence."

0,"I had originally thought of getting this product for our son who is off to college in the fall.  Right now all of our household computers are hooked into&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Windows-Home-Server-OEM/dp/B000VWW8QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Windows Home Server OEM</a>&nbsp;so our anti-virus and backups are centrally managed.  However, when he leaves for college that won't be an option for him.  I wanted something that was easy to use and didn't bog his laptop down.  Unfortunately, although OneCare is a good product, it just didn't fit the bill.

First off, let me say the product has a lot of nice features -- including automated backups, firewall, anti-virus and more rolled into one thing.  However, as I've learned in the past, sometimes rolling too many features into a product can give you a less than stellar offering.  It's hard to be the ""best"" in every category -- and I think this is where OneCare suffers.

I found the Firewall to be terribly annoying.  I prefer to leave software-based firewalls turned OFF because hardware-based firewalls are much more reliable.  When I did this I got not one, but two red icons in my task area on Windows XP that would not go away.  Unlike the built-in firewall with Windows XP/Vista, turning OneCare's firewall off does not give you the option to ignore the condition and remove the red icons.  In this way I felt the program was way too demanding to be wanting to do everything when all I wanted was a subset of its features.

Next, I noticed that the backup feature of OneCare and the backup feature of Windows Home Server was not integrating correctly.  The product states that it ""recognizes"" the backup feature of WHS, but I found out that two backups were trying to occur every night.  I searched around some and couldn't find any real documentation or options for fixing the problem.

The anti-virus feature worked well, and in fact seemed to run just a bit faster than my current anti-virus program, Avast.  Updates happened automatically and it was pretty much non-intrusive.  No complaints there.

There were other features that would be handy for novice users, such as cleaning up the temporary files that Windows and IE seem to leave around as well as a feature to scan your system for missed updates, etc.  Again, these are features a novice user might enjoy so they don't have to manage their computer as much.

However, my overall impression was that OneCare is ""good"" but just doesn't make it into the ""great"" category.  I'd say if you have one or two PC's without a home network then this program will work for you just fine.  If you are a more tech-savy computer user then you'll probably find yourself fighting the program more than getting a lot of value out of it."

-0.5,"I usually don't do OS upgrades, but I wanted to give this a try to see if Windows 8 would breathe some new life into my laptop. The installation was not difficult, but it did take awhile. Once it was done, I was confronted with the new Metro interface. It was mostly downhill from there. It goes without saying that Windows 8 is geared more towards tablets than it is towards desktop PCs. That is not the biggest issue that I have with Windows 8 though. The main issue that I had was that it seems that for some reason they made tasks that were easy to preform in Windows 7 a pain to preform in Windows 8.

Getting to the control panel is more of a challenge than it should be. It used to take only two clicks to get there. In Windows 8 it takes considerably more effort. In the old Start Menu, you could simply type the name of the program that you wanted to open in the search file and folders field. In Windows 8, one you use the ""charms bar"" to get to the search field. The search field is divided separately into apps, settings, etc.. This means that you can do a search for a setting (like backup for example), and you will get no results. You have to select settings from the search options for the correct items to show up. This means that you could miss a setting or an app if you don't have the right option selected. That is a big change from the unified search that was in Windows 7.

I hear that Windows 8.1 will fix a lot of the usability issues reported in Windows 8. I sure hope so. Otherwise I would not recommend it to Windows users unless you got it by default in a new PC purchase."
0.5,"I tested this software on both Windows Vista SP1 and Mac OS 10.5.6 this past weekend and it seems to work fine on both.  I used a new Wacom Intuos 4 Tablet with the software.  The software seems fairly easy to learn how to use and I think for the amount of money asked(under $100) it is a great product.  One thing I really appreciated is that Autodesk does not seem to use irritating product activation like a lot of software companies do these days.  The responsiveness of the brush engine to user input is excellent.  It provides smooth trouble free operation unlike what happens sometimes with competing products.  This makes drawing pure pleasure.

All in all this product is highly recommended as a low cost solution."

After you get used to everything here, it becomes second  nature (but just takes a while as with everything else).  Once I got the hang of this system, I really enjoyed it's ""depth"" the most.  Yes, it has depth (or breadth) of functionale, but what I mean is, you are really able to easily pinpoint numbers from a statement.  If you have a question about some number on an income statement, you're able to click on that for much further detail to figure out what it entails.  This kind of depth is extremely beneficial as it saves a lot of time trying to search for the meaning behind a number."

0,"First off if you use avchd (.mts) files then it is worth the upgrade with the hd plugin. Why ? Well it will actually convert your .mts files to mp4,psp,appletv, etc... straight from the raw .mts file which up to know was a total pain because you need imovieHD08 to read the avchd file then pull off the huge .mov file and then convert...
Tost9 will see the .mts file and work with it... Also the Toast Video Player will PLAY the .mts file ! Thats a first! However there is no editing that it can do so bummer there.

No the weird stuff... you are suppose to be able to take a avchd file and burn it on to a standard dvd-r for hi def playback on a bluray player... but my PS3 sees the disc as a data disc ... others have said there player sees it fine... so its not totally reliable yet... same goes for hd-dvd, I made a hi def disc on standard dvd-r and it played back wonderfully on my Toshiba A30 player but my xbox 360's hd drive hated the disc... so the same problem exists there too. If you really want to get your avchd onto dvd-r but play in hi def buy the Sony VRD-MC5 and save yourself a lot of grief.... But I hope Roxio will address these issues.

Other than that the Toast9 pretty much does what it always has done for cd burning....

I am excited about what Toast9 is trying to do to get avchd in motion so if you use these cameras this is the first real piece of software that can deal with these files (converting them) that I have seen for the Mac. iMovie08 just transcode the file to a different codec but Toast will read them and convert them straight from your hard drive as is... no camera hookup or card needed like imovie...

If it wasn't for the hiccups of bluray to dvd-r I would give it more stars. If your using Toast8 I really would not bother with Toast9. If your using avchd then its well worth the buy."

This Dragon Dictate for Mac is truly astonishing.  Now, I'm not comparing it to anything recent.  I'm comparing it to the voice-recognition on my smart phone and my mom's program from the 90s.  The most shocking thing about the program:  You don't have to speak slower for the software to understand you.  Once you go through the tutorial (what I'll call it), it understands you at a high rate of speed.  The main problem (and the star deduction) is for the formatting issues. It would take awhile for me to actually be able to use the program to create a professional document; it would still be faster for me to type it and format as I go.

0,"Anti-virus and spyware programs offer some of the choicest morsels in the freeware phenomenon.

 This program is typical of its commercial genre: big, slow and a resource hog. Anti-virus and spyware programs should be left to run t night or whenever else you are not using the computer.

 I don't have any kind of formal procedure for testing spyware programs. I run a commercial anti-virus and spyware package and occasionally run freeware programs to see how each performs against the others. PCTools Spyware Doctor isn't perfect when measured against competitors. It didn't miss anything on my pretty clean system, nor did it find anything the others didn't. Identifying actual malware from entities such as legitimate Registry entries and Cookies is as tedious as it is with other programs and not as bad as some others. The great danger of these programs is that for many users, they are dangerous weapons - it is very simple to delete a critical Registry entry.

 Overall, I think experienced users would probably be just as happy - if not happier - with one of the well known freeware products. Inexperienced users might be better served with a better featured program that includes anti-virus capabilities.

1,Absolutely fantastic program. Beyond all my expectations. I recommend buying it and learning how to use it.
0.5,Worked as advertised.
0,"I purchased this version (2009) after taking a look at the other versions and comparing content and price. On one DVD, you are getting essentially a textbook with a few extras that will be good for years to come. I think this is a good reference for several different types of mathematics that students will encounter from middle school through college, but in all honesty, I purchased it with my daughter in mind. She's currently taking Pre-Algebra in 6th grade and I wanted to give her a leg-up by offering a supplement at home that was not her textbook.

After playing with the software myself these are my impressions.

INTERFACE: How it Looks

This program is not overly appealing visually, but it's not terrible either. If you have the sound on, the voices (several are used depending upon where you are in the program) are a bit boring. Can anyone really fix that one though?  In parts of the program the makers use a space-age theme; in the Algebra Booster for example, there is a math game designed to help kids think algebraically while doing a Pac-Man type game. I played it and found it to be 'OK'.  My 11 year old wasn't overly impressed, but I think she was expecting it to play like her other video games. Bottom line: It really looks like something from 1999 versus 2009.

CONTENT:  What's on the DVD?

For each of the math subjects: Basic Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra I... through Calculus and Statistics, there are tabs at the top of the screen.

 ""Lessons"" has subcatagories of 'Basics' and 'Chapters'.  This is basically like a textbook or reference book that you can read when you need it.  Another tab, ""Challenge"" is a problem that in the end asks you questions, but I didn't find an answer to the question... just more questions.  I guess it's designed to help students think a bit deeper.  The third tab is ""Exercises"", which as you would imagine has questions relating to whatever subject inside a math type you are studying.  If you get the wrong answer, it tells you you're wrong, but since they are multiple choice, you never get an explanation, you just get to choose again.  You can view your score and get a report on which ones you got right and wrong to review.  ""Real Life"" is a story problem.  Using the current skill set to solve an every-day issue.  ""Animation"" is a short video illustrating the current skill. It's the company's attempt to 'cartoon up' the software. For visual learners this will be helpful, but the few I viewed were kind of stupid.

The DVD also has bonus applications:  Runes of Avalon and Calculus Ipod material.  I couldn't get the link for the ipod material to open on my computer despite having iTunes and an Ipod Touch, but the game, Runes of Avalon, did install and I played it. It's more a spacial recognition game versus a math game, but it looks good (better than the rest of the software) and the gameplay was smooth.

A strange addition to the package was a CD with animal screensavers on it. The animals look like they are licking your monitor clean. Cute, but seemed like it fell into the wrong box!

CONCLUSION: Would I buy it again? Was it what I was looking for in math-help software?

I got a heck of a deal on this one - under 10 dollars when the local warehouse store was still selling it for over thirty. If I'd paid more, I probably would be a bit irked, but for the money paid... I'm happy. I would buy it again and recommend it as a 'reference' source.

As for whether it was what I was looking for... yes and no. I expected explanations of the subjects listed. I got that and examples, just like a textbook would offer. What I didn't get was the ability to print off worksheets and answer sheets for practice. That would have been great! I found a few places online with free worksheets and some paid sites, but I had hopes that this would offer this and it didn't. Some more games would have been great too, as would the ability of the software to give feedback on a step-by-step basis, versus simply 'wrong' and then you figure it out.

This is a good math resource for any math students seeking a supplement to their current textbook, but it is not software that's filled with useful games and printable worksheets. I found the Cliff notes books (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Algebra-I-Cliffs-Quick-Review/dp/076456370X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Algebra I (Cliffs Quick Review)</a>&nbsp;to be just as helpful, but I couldn't put them on my computer and it would be much more expensive to get them all versus this dvd."
1,"This is easily the most comprehensive language instruction package I've ever seen. With four separate units, each split into several different sections -- including listening, speaking, vocabulary and grammar -- Rosetta Stone provides hours and hours of easy-to-use instruction in learning to speak and understand Japanese like an expert.

A language package like this requires the user to be a self-starter. There's nobody pushing you to use it or assessing your performance. The lack of feedback might prove challenging for some users. But if you're willing to push yourself, this system really works. (Of course, one advantage to this method is that you're able to move at your own pace.)

Rosetta Stone comes with a high price tag. But if you're serious about learning Japanese, and have the discipline to follow a program on your own, your purchase will be money well spent."
0.5,"I used pretty much all the big antivirus packages out there. Currently I am using F-Secure antivirus and I have mixed feelings about it.
Previously I used Kaspersky Security Suite and I didn't like it mostly because of the annoying firewall. As an antivirus I was always happy with it.

This package includes only the antivirus and is pretty solid. It installs without problems and it works. If you are worried about having on the CD an earlier version (build) that might have installation issues, you can always download the latest from Kaspersky and activate it with the serial number provided.

Kaspersky is a well-known name in the security software community and it always has one of the top places when somebody does a test on multiple security suites or antivirus programs.

The load on the system is not slowing it down, at least not on my machine, but maybe on older computers it could be a problem.

The only issue I have with this software is again the Kaspersky firewall. Since the firewall is not part of this package it is indirectly affecting it. Like most users, I would like to have a security suite rather than individual products made by different software vendors. In this case, I cannot have the anti-virus without having the Kaspersky firewall, therefore, no matter how good the antivirus I will not use that in combination with say Norton Firewall. This makes this product of limited value for me and I will probably not buy it by itself. The only use I can see for this as a standalone antivirus is on a test machine when you want to scan your suspect files with different antivirus programs."

Upon launching, it detected my Logitech 920 web camera and I was able to capture a quick one minute movie of my hand moving my  usb microphone back and forth.  The program locked up on me and I was forced to cancel it and relaunch.  The brief short was rendered when the program came back up.  I was able to record some audio and incorporate it.

I didn't see any preloaded content (backgrounds, audio, and music).  Clearly, you can browse to your own and copy it into the desired location.  Also, you can add titles and end credits easily.

All things considered, the interface is easy to use and fairly straightforward. My oldest daughter (age 12) will probably enjoy using it to create animated adventures of her Monster High dolls  It might be a bit difficult for my youngest at age 5, but it seems like a project that I could help her with."

While it does work much better then the version I had previously, I believe I had the 2011 version.  It does work without most of the time with my bank downloads  It allows you break down your payments into more groupings if that is important to you."

0,"I have used Kaspersky for a while, because its more affordable than some other options for what you get. However it does slow the computer quite a bit. The security feature ""secure money"" whatever its called that opens a new secure window when ever you buy something, or do online banking, is a huge pain. Its very glitchy and I'm not sure how much it really helps. A full system scan takes FOREVER. I have to make sure I start it before I go to bed because they've been taking 7+ hours. The last one only took 2.5 hours and that shocked me, which is sad because that is still really long. When a scan is going, the computer is so slow I can't even use it (without flying into an impatient rage). However, I have never gotten any viruses or had any security breaches with my laptop so it appears to be doing its job."
0,"I'm a bit leery of this product. I've been a Norton customer since it first started providing security services. The product detail says 25GB of Online Backup, but I receive a 5GB Online Back Up card via Amazon Vine. Where my skepticism comes in is the product is an annual product like all other Norton products. In addition to this product being comparible to services like DropBox, Box, and SkyDrive, I looked through the TOS and the product paperwork that came in the package for what happens to my back ups provided I do NOT renew this service on an annual basis. Do I lose access to what I've already backed up? If this is the case, this could be detrimental and I would suffer a loss of my personal files. I currently have a ticket into Norton to see what happens to my files provided I do not renew. I will post their response when I receive an answer, but I am not going to back up anything until I know the answer. One would thing that this would displayed clearly somewhere in the TOS. Now the actual product is 25GB is a a good amount, however, it is still comparable to the other online storage and back up services I mentioned above. With that being said, I already pay Norton in excess of $120 for Cyber Security products and multiple family back ups across devices, do I want to give them another $25 for online storage? You may want to bypass this one, but I will post the response from Norton about the ""shelf-life"" of my back ups as soon as I hear from them."
0,"Compared to the 2002 version, there is nothing exceptional about this 2003 version of Norton SystemWorks Professional. It is just a better organized 2002 model with minor additions. Like the core 2002 base, it maintained its traditional AntiVirus, Utilities, CleanSweep, and Ghost components. Overall, it remains a good software, but surely not a-must-have upgrade, especially if you are happy with an earlier version that is not more than three years old. However, for new intending users and those with versions older than three years, grab it if you can. The price is not out of reach."
1,"Great 8-port switch.  I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then."
-0.5,good on delivery but having a problem on the install. I have last years on one computer and it keeps telling me its expired but I try to install this disc and nothing happens. I also have an apple and it says it does not expire for 3 months so that is ok but what if in 3 months it will not let me install then? Anyway I need help getting it installed on the first computer with the expired software?
0.5,"Wow. This software - Corel Video Studio Ultimate X6 - is pretty powerful and yet intuitive enough to use without too much of a learning curve, particularly if you've never used any of the previous versions.

The price is reasonable for what you get which is the Video Studio program and all of its special effect features, stop motion capabilities, subtitles, HD video support, animation, screen capture and on and on. Also some additional programs on the second disc and a number of templates are included. One flaw - no instruction manual. You need to get it online with the download instructions in the box. A slightly lesser flaw - the program creates lots of temp files. Not sure why or if there's a way to correct that. Or if it's my own user error.

I've been working on a little stop action short film. It's pretty interesting to be able to try this though I'm still in a bit of a learning curve right now which I'm muddling through bit by bit. I found some useful videos on youtube that actually did help me.

As far as output, you have the following capabilities: AVI, MPEG-2, AVCHD, MPEG-4, H.264, BDMV, HDV, QuickTime, RealVideo, Windows Media Format, 3GPP, 3GPP2, WebM, Audio: Dolby Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1, MPA, M4A, WAV, QuickTime, Windows Media Audio, Ogg Vorbis, Images: BMP, JPG, Disc: DVD (DVD-Video/DVD-VR/AVCHD), Blu-ray Disc (BDMV), Media: CD-R/RW DVD-R/RW, DVD+R/RW, DVD-R Dual Layer, DVD+R Double Layer, BD-R/RE.

This review comes from a place of a person learning, not from a seasoned film professional who has used multiple types of software and can compare across products. I think the demographic for this is, in fact, the lay person who wants to try their hand at editing. But for what it's worth, I'm really liking this and finding it not so difficult to tackle."
0.5,"NIS provides excellent protection and the family license is nice to have. The 2014 runs even faster and smoother than the 2013 did. NIS includes phishing and malware protection - or they claim to, I haven't had any known issues. Installation was fast and easy, but I know from prior experience, if I want to un-install it, it will probably take a lot longer.

The only thing I don't like is all the nagging emails and messages you get. Again this is from prior experience with Norton, they will start sending a bunch of emails and there will be pop up message dialogs will dire warnings if I fail to renew."
1,"There are a ton of digital media streaming devices out right now and a lot of them claim they work for digital signage.  They don't.  This one does.  You plug it into an HDMI on any TV or monitor, log it into your Wi-Fi and then create an account on their wensite and you can immediately create any presentation you want.  I have 3 coffee shops and this lets me create new content and post it toall of them at once with no software fee."
1,"I've always liked WordPerfect. It's really easy to use and the environment is comfortable and intuitive. This version is a clear improvement over the last one.

The tools you're used to are still there, but what makes it better is the editing tools for PDF type documents. I bought Adobe Acrobat because I needed to be able to do some things with fillable forms, but still did my formatting in WordPerfect then amended the documents in Acrobat for the functionality I needed. This version of WordPerfect, I can create the documents with all the form functions I need.

It installed easily on my Windows 7 machine. It doesn't slow down my whole system to work with it. I can open my graphics program while running WordPerfect if necessary, and it handles large documents with lots of images and tags well."
1,"Gives me what I need to support basic legal needs (agreements, contracts, lease, loans, etc.)  You need to know some legal ins and outs to make sure what you do is within the acceptable laws of your state."
1,"The Quicken Willmaker Plus 2015 software worked without problems on a Windows 8.1 system.  Prior to testing I made sure the program was updated to the latest version.  The software is very comprehensive and is designed to be used via a wizard like interface that walks the user through each step necessary to create a document.  I found it really simple and easy to use.

Overall the software worked really well with no issues observed.  It should be noted I tested a later version of the software - so the problems others had with earlier versions are not there.  I found the software includes just about every kind of form one would never need for estate planning. The software comes with a printed book Legal Answers For Families.

All in all this is an excellent tool and highly recommended.  Prior to using always make sure it is updated to the latest version to take care of any changes necessary to the forms or the software to fix any problems that may come up."
1,"Unit came used, but in fine condition. Seems to be working well. I have not tried any advanced functionality as I just got a null-modem cable to get into that part."
1,You can get the bundle discount on digital downloads of Quicken and Turbo Tax even though the digital purchase does not go through the cart.  After phoning customer support I purchased Turbo Tax and then purchased Quicken.  At payment time for the Quicken the total was reduced by the $35 bundle reduction.  So it did work :-)
0,"Word editing application works fine for anyone wanting an alternative to Word.
On the other hand don't know why they even both to throw in the AfterShot image editing program because its:
#1 already out of date since version 3 is out
#2 tends to crash way too much making it all but useless as an alternative to other image editing programs I use

Anyways, if you're trying to get away from the current subscription model of buying software these days you can't go wrong with using this since it can open even the latest version of Office documents just fine from the limited testing I did."
1," Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:
 Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!

I originally started using Corel's VideoStudio software beginning with version X2.  With this X4 version, Corel continues to add new features and useful enhancements, important bug fixes and crucial improvements to software stability, along with performance and speed boosts by taking advantage of Intel's and AMD's new CPUs and also GPU acceleration provided by specific Nvidia graphics processors.  One really cool performance feature offered by VideoStudio is that it has a ""Smart Proxy"" editing mode, where you can edit high-definition video in a low-resolution mode, thereby allowing you to use a slower computer without necessarily slowing down to a sluggish crawl.  These performance enhancements offer a huge advantage because many of us do not upgrade our computers frequently with the latest fastest CPU processors.  So some of the other brands of video editing software may be unbearably slow on these slower computers (even to the point of completely freezing up) while VideoStudio X4 can still zip along with a decent amount of responsiveness on slower computers.

Even though I do not like how Corel has organized the user interface layout for their PaintShop Pro X4 photo-editing software, I continue to like the changes and improvements that they have made to this VideoStudio X4.  I can resize, drag, dock, and undock various windows and UI elements to suit my workspace preferences and everything seems to behave intuitively.  But as with how Corel has designed their help system for PaintShop Pro X4 software, the one aspect of the VideoStudio X4 user interface that I really dislike is that to access the help menus, I am forced to hop through intermediate menus before it launches the online help from Corel's Web site using my browser.  With both PaintShop Pro X4 and VideoStudio X4, I now just bookmark the help information URLs and access them directly from my browser instead of clicking the cumbersome help button from within the application.  Even though the latest and most up-to-date online help information can be dynamically accessed directly from Corel's Web site when using this browser approach, I would still really prefer the previous approach of at least being given the option during the installation of the software to load the full help documentation on my computer's local hard drive since that also gives me the freedom to access the user manuals and help guides when I use the software without having Internet access.

I had fun using the new time-lapse photography feature.  I used a Canon Timer Remote Controller TC-80N3 to shoot a series of timer-delayed photos of the sun setting behind the mountains and another cool every-two-minutes photo series that I made last summer of a morning glory vine slowly opening up its blooms, and then I used the VideoStudio X4's time-lapse photography feature to create a video from both of these photo series that look like a sped-up time-lapse movie.  If both videos had been recorded as real-time videos, they would have been mind-numbingly boring to watch, but when sped up using the time-lapse feature, they allow everyday people like me to showcase the wonders of nature just like how the professional movies and television nature programs use time-lapse photography.

The software lets me use both standard definition and HD videos, and editing, authoring, and burning of both video types is easy.  The software is very flexible in importing videos from your hard drive or capturing them directly from your video recorders.  There are flexible options for viewing your files in different ways such as timeline or storyboard modes, which are useful for adding videos, pictures, text, audio and music tracks.  You can also trim or split your video into sections for better continuity, adding transitions and enhancing with many kinds of built-in effects.  Once you upload your video, you can trim and divide the video into clips.  Trimming is marking the beginning and ending of an entire clip, while multi-trimming is useful to divide one segment into multiple clips.  Multi-trimming is very useful for editing out various parts of a recorded video to exclude sections that are boring or extraneous.  This software's trimming functions are powerful and very easy to use, allowing me to feel like a Hollywood film director while I edit my videos to make them flow seamlessly between different scenes.

As with previous versions of VideoStudio, you can import photos to create a photo slideshow along with adding text and music accompaniment.  The software is very flexible for adding music or audio voiceovers to your video projects from a variety of sources.  You can add audio to your projects in Corel VideoStudio X4 using various methods such as adding audio files to the library from your hard drive, ripping music from a CD, or recording a voiceover clip.  You can edit the audio clips using a built-in sound mixer to adjust the volume, length and duration, fade-in/fade-out, and apply various mixing and sound filter effects to the audio tracks.  The video editor does limit you to six overlay video tracks along with your main video track, combined with up to two title tracks, a voice track, and three music tracks.  While this is less than some video-editing software that lets you incorporate many dozens of tracks, it is more than sufficient for the vast majority of everyday users (like me) who mainly work with personal videos and it is sufficient even for editing important events like videos of weddings and vacations.

After you have finished editing your video masterpiece, you can export in a variety of common formats including FLV files for YouTube, MPG (MPEG-1/MPEG-2), AVCHD, WMV HD, Windows Media, RealMedia, AVI, and QuickTime.  You also have the option to upload your work to Vimeo, Facebook, Flickr, and YouTube.  The software can create menus for DVD, Blu-ray, AVCHD, and it offers eight Blu-ray and twelve DVD menu choices.  This X4 version also adds new 3D video capabilities.  Even though I admit that I am a 3D video editing newbie, this feature seems limited and fairly rudimentary in its 3D rendering options, but it can create some pretty cool eye-popping 3D effects and is easy to use.  This will NOT get you the kind of 3D video that Hollywood can create, but it does add another dimension of ""eye candy Wow factor"" to your videos...  Just don't expect to create your own version of an ""Avatar 3D"" movie.  3D glasses are included with the software.

The ""Ultimate"" extras that are included in this software consist of proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software and Boris Graffiti 5.3 for text/title/graphics animation and 3D effects.  The proDAD Mercalli SE video correction/stabilization software really makes a noticeable difference to stabilize and remove the shake from my videos, which I mostly shoot hand-held.

This is a big complex software application that really requires some patience for you to slowly become more familiar with all of its features and power.  But its user interface is cleanly designed so that newbie first-timers can start editing their videos with ease without fully mastering all of its powerful features.  Fortunately, Corel also provides plenty of online help along with easy-to-use templates and more than 60 really cool special effects and more than 150 transition effects to let you experiment and try out many of its flexible options so even video-editing newbies can create a polished slick video with ease.  The software uses a nondestructive editing approach so that your original video file is not being directly modified along the way.  This also allows you to experiment, even trying out wacky ideas and special effects, turning a tedious chore into a fun playtime of creating video eye candy.

Back when I was using VideoStudio X2, the software had various erratic and quirky bugs and serious stability issues; it can be disheartening to have the software freeze up after you have spent more than an hour editing a video.  Many of these problems have thankfully been resolved in this version X4; not once did I encounter a freeze-up or crash during my edits using X4.  When used on an older slower Windows Vista laptop of mine, the software can be sluggishly slow sometimes, but I prefer dealing with slower performance on a slower computer than having to deal with annoying software bugs and applications that freeze up or crash on me, so I accept the fact that I have to wait longer when using VideoStudio X4 on a slower laptop that is more than four years old.  As with any video editing software, especially when editing HD videos, your best experience will result from using a fast computer with lots of memory.  While this VideoStudio X4 lacks some of the features and has more track-editing limitations when compared to both CyberLink PowerDirector and Adobe Premiere, I think that it beats those two when it comes to multi-trim clip editing, key framing, and its best-in-class stop-motion and time-lapse animation capabilities.  And VideoStudio X4 is far easier and more intuitive to learn for a newbie compared to Adobe Premiere's dense complexity.  If this software was priced at $300, I would rate it 4 stars or maybe 3.5 stars, but with its inexpensive list price and Corel's frequent heavy pricing discounts, I rate it 5 stars because you really do get a lot of video editing bang for the buck here.  And if you are not technically adept, have some patience as you familiarize yourself with the software.

Also, Corel has released two important service pack patch updates for VideoStudio Pro X4.  After installing VideoStudio Pro on your computer, you can either download these large executable files from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service packs that way."
1,"Over the years, I have used any number of photo editing and graphics programs, ranging from Adobe PhotoShop to CorelDraw to PaintShop Pro.  However, I've never used anything quite like Painter Essentials 5.

This program is designed to help you convert your photographs into art.  It has a number of tools that will let you paint using your photographs as a jumping off point.  It also has filters and algorithms that will automatically convert your photographs into pre-selected styles (e.g., watercolor).  The program gives you controls of numerous parameters and is quite powerful for the price.

I have toyed around with it using a mouse and also a Bamboo pad and pen.  Both work well.  You don't have to be a whiz to get in and start fooling around.  However, if you want to do anything serious with this program, prepare to spend some time learning its process.  The online help isn't bad, but to get the most out of this you'll have to spend some time with it.

It installed and ran like a breeze on an Intel i7-3770K machine I built a few years ago, running Windows 8.1 with 16gb of RAM and a decent AMD video card.  The controls were smooth and responsive.

If you have a yen to make painterly scenes or portraits from your photographs, this is a powerful program that will let you do it.  Just be ready to invest time learning how to get the most out of it."
0.5,"First, I ran it for one month.  It seemed to be fine, nothing unusual. Then I did get a problem that was similar but not nearly as bad as one of the other reviews.  I had some boot problems, and when I contacted customer support,they gave me easy to follow instructions as well as an update and no more problems seemed to occur.  I kept it for a year, until my subscription was up, and went to the free Norton Antivirus Suite that Comcast gives their customers.  Overall, did a good job.  Not cheap, though."
1,great product this was not a fake
1,"This is the perfect switch for someone looking for an affordable managed switch, quite and robust."
1,No issues. Good deal.
1,"This review is based on release candidate 2 (RC2). Can I say anything but Kudos? The new interface is intuitive to the max. It's a big step above former versions of Windows and even a cut above Macs. Stability is, well, I can't get it to crash. Compatibility is phenomenal. DOS, Win 3.1 and Win9x programs run without a problem (remember, this is based on the NT file system and kernel, not the DOS-based file system and kernel). This is what Windows was meant to be when version 1.0 came out. OK, it took 9 years to get it to this level but, now that it's where it's meant to be, there is no reason not to get it if your computer will run it. Most people will be satisfied with the home version. If you have a business or are a real computer geek, then you may want the Pro version. Installation is a snap (takes about an hour) and, if you decide that it's not for you, it uninstalls easily.
For me there's no going back. I think that you'll feel the same way once you try it."
1,"I am a total amateur when it comes to editing, but needed to try something for editing the photos I take for my business.

This software was a quick and easy download.  Once downloaded, I was able to start using it pretty quickly, the learning curve was one that I could understand without too much trial and error.

I take many photos of different items in the same location, so when I need to edit, it's generally the same thing which needs editing, this software is perfect for that.  Now I can fix multiple photos at one time, saving a lot of time!

The price is great if you're not sure about the program, not a huge expense like many others out there.

For me, and my level of expertise, or lack of it, this program fits the bill!"
-0.5,"I bought the expensive TurboTax Business to do the taxes for two trusts held at our broker.  Quess what?  This expensive version can not download those transactions into the program.  WHY!!!!  I would expect most trusts have investments held at a broker, but TurboTax doesd not see fit to give you an easy way to get those transactions into the tax return.

The reasonably priced Deluxe version works just fine at downloading those same transactions into my personal tax return.  So I had to manually enter each one of the stock transactions."
-1,Well I guess its my own fault for not reading everything but at the time that I picked this on my vine list the information on it wasn't very clear. I thought I was ordering a external DVD drive. And it was probably more wishful thinking since I really need a new DVD drive for my laptop. Since it's a program and my DVD drive isn't working I cant install it right now. So for now I cant use it and since it is a Vine item I cant send it back. Once I get a DVD drive or get a new laptop then I will be able to install it and test drive it. Then I will come back and update my review.
1,I simply cannot state the excellence of this software.  You will not be sorry for this purchase.  I give it a two thumbs up.

0,"problems installations.  Surprised me, really.  But I use XP and I see some others has similar problems.  I have been making book video trailers and this was recommended to me.  It does have a virtual maze of options.  Some didn't function for me, and others I am still learning.  It's not 1, 2, 3, go...that's for sure.  The slide shows with music was nice, but them you can do that on Rockme.com without the headache of learning this program.  Not sure the average user will enjoy this program for it's just too much of everything.  I will keep giving it a try but so far, thinking I will give Pinnacle a go, too.  Heard it does as much, but it's easier to use."

-1,I have had Acronis installed on two different computers. Backup images were created by Acronis successfully  to secondary hard drives (pata) and external usb2(pata) hard drives and backups validated by Acronis software.  In both cases Acronis gave a E000101F4 error indicating it could not find a hard drive disk when attempting to 1)actually restore and 2)to just test a Acronis boot cd.  Error was given in both cases when using a Acronis bootable cd and trying to restore from Windows XP pro via Acronis program. Latest software update version was used from Acronis. Save your cash.
0.5,"While in middle school and high school we were required to take a foreign language course, so I ended up taking French, Spanish, and Japanese. Eventually French was the only one I continued through high school and eventually college.  Since then, I have never had a need to use French so I have pretty much forgotten all I've learned.  I later realized Spanish was a language I could have use for today, but my past Spanish computer courses I've purchases not helpful at all and downright boring.  RosettaStone was going to be my next purchase until I saw the price; much more expensive than I expected it to be.  I eventually planned on getting it, but not anytime in the foreseeable future.  I had an opportunity to try and keep the Spanish version of RosettaStone so you can image I jumped on the opportunity quickly.

As I am going through Level 1 of the three level course, I am finding out already that I am enjoying RosettaStone's approach to learning as opposed to the other courses I have had.  RosettaStone uses a ""Dynamic Immersion"" approach which basically teaches you the language very similar to the way you learned your first language.  After the very first lesson I found myself being able to associate everyday objects with the things I learned in the language.  More importantly it seems to stick.  My high school French teacher taught us that repetition is the key to learning a new language and if you don't use it then you will lose it.  RosettaStone follows this same principle; at the beginning of every lesson the software always goes over what you've learned in the previous lessons to reinforce what you've learned.  It also comes with audio companion CD's you can listen to in your car or at work that will also go over with what has been learned.

The RosettaStone software focuses on four major areas; reading, speaking, writing, and vocabulary.  Most of the reading and vocabulary exercises require you matching up pictures up with what the speaker says and what displays on the screen.  Pronunciation exercises require you to repeat what the speaker says with the provided USB Headphones/microphone.  Writing exercises require you to write/spell in Spanish using the on screen keyboard.  The software even comes with stickers you can place over your existing keyboard to make typing easier.  RosettaStone is very visual which is important to learning a new language.  From what I have observed, RosettaStone does not use translations at all. Instead, with the aid of visual references it actually teaches Spanish independent of your native language.  So instead of trying to remember ""una manzana"" = apple or ""un huevo"" = egg, you are taught to associate the word, phrase, or sentence with a mental picture which I think makes things stick.  Keep in mind this is just one example of how RosettaStone teaches you your new language.

Honestly, after going through to first few lessons, while I agreed I was learning, I didn't think I was learning THAT much, however that view changed when the software required me to identify objects and phrases on the screen by spelling them without any help from the speaker.  I thought I would fail the lesson, but I surprised myself; ending up getting all but one correct.  It was as if I was doing the activity subconsciously.

My only real complaint was the poor customer service experience I had when calling RosettaStone Customer Support to inform them that the Spanish Keyboard stickers were printed incorrectly.  On Spanish keyboards pressing Shift + a number 4 - 0 will produce a different character than an English keyboard:

On a Spanish Keyboard, pressing shift in conjunction with numbers 4 - 0 should produce the following characters:

Shift + 4 = ""$""
Shift + 5 = ""%""
Shift + 6 = ""&""
Shift + 7 = ""/""
Shift + 8 = ""(""
Shift + 9 = "")""
Shift + 0 = ""=""

However the Spanish stickers included with RosettaStone are printed as:

Shift + 4 = ""%""
Shift + 5 = ""&""
Shift + 6 = ""/""
Shift + 7 = ""(""
Shift + 8 = "")""
Shift + 9 = ""=""
Shift + 0 =

After being on hold for nearly 20 minutes, I finally get to a live person, I tried to explain the issue to the customer service rep, but this guy was completely clueless on what I was talking about and the only solution was for me to press the shift button...ok.  Before getting too involved with a long drawn out frustrating conversation, I asked to speak to someone else.  He transfers me and again I am on hold for a long period of time before speaking to a ""senior technical rep"" I tell her the issue and she tells me that she can just have RosettaStone send me more keyboard stickers.  I am transferred again, and yet again am on hold for a while.  When speaking to the new person, she informs me that RosettaStone does NOT send out the stickers separately, but suggested I buy some from another company for $12.  When I tell her that the keyboard stickers are printed incorrectly she says she would bring it to someone's attention...yeah right.  After wasting nearly an hour with RosettaStone Customer Support I hung up more dissatisfied then I was when I first called.  In fact the original issue wasn't really a big of a deal, but I felt the need to let someone know so they could fix it for future customers; but instead, I get bad customer service.  I eventually fixed the stickers myself with the help of a razor, simply putting the symbols above the numbers in their correct places.

Other than the bad customer service experience, my only concern right now is that the course may be rather short even though it's three levels.  I am still very early in the course so perhaps that may not be a concern at all.  Also since I am very early in the course, there is no way I can honestly say if it's worth the hefty price tag, but I will say I am very impressed so far, and am very eager to continue my learning.  However be aware if you need to call customer support that you will be on hold for a while and there is no guarantee that they will even be able to help you plus they are not the most polite people I have had to deal with but hopefully you won't even have to deal with them.

Independent of the customer service I'll give it a rounded up value of 5, but the bad customer service experience is something I can't ignore, so for that it gets a 4."

0,"In theory, 360 2.0 is a comprehensive all-in-one security package that frees the user from the need to remain cognizant of maintenance needs, especially if one has multiple PCs to be serviced, and for newer units with mid to upper range capability that is the case.

After months of ambivalence (and waiting for the supposed automatic offer), I decided to upgrade from version 1.0 to 2.0 on three computers: One desktop with 4 GB of memory with Vista Ultimate, a laptop with Vista home premium and 2GB memory, and an 8 yearold but highly reliable CPU with only 256MB memory. Version 1.0 ran adequately on the first two units and from all appearances this version 2.0 is not as resource intensive as the earlier version however, LiveUpdate remains an annoyance.

Similarly to version 1.0, it appears the only other Norton product that is compatible with 360 is Norton Ghost.

In the case of the older unit, performance of Norton 360  was consistently problematic so I was not surprised to encounter difficulties with the upgrade however I had no inkling of the extent of encumbrances I would face in what from a cursory view appeared to be a rather benign installation.

Like security suites offered by other vendors version 2.0 includes virus protection (unfortunately still updated via LiveUpdate whereas NIS 2009 is migrating to real time updating) firewall, spyware and intrusion protection, email scanning, parental controls and anti-spam filtering. The latter mentioned features are available as add-on packs accessible from Symantec's website. This version also enhances network monitoring capabilities and expands supported media for backups. Curiously, and incongruently, while network attached storage devices like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Netgear-RND2150-ReadyNAS-Duo-500-GB-Desktop-Network-Attached-Storage/dp/B0013G04AQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Netgear RND2150 ReadyNAS Duo 500 GB Desktop Network Attached Storage</a>&nbsp;are discovered by network monitoring, automatic backup to the same device is not supported. It should also be noted the only qualitative difference I can see between the standard version and the premier version of 2.0 is the increased online secure backup storage of  10GB in the case of the premier edition. Standard edition availability is 2GB and in my opinion neither is sufficient. As an all in one product, some compromises in user control could be anticipated however it would have been an advantage if the user was offered the capability to backup individual files rather than continuing the limitation to classes of folders. Essentially, while backup to ipods is intriguing, I see little advantage to employing this backup facility over the functionality existent in both XP and Vista operating systems.

The network monitoring feature is beneficial but is flawed to the extent multiple devices connected to a single access point  like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NETGEAR-HD-Gaming-5-GHz-Wireless-N-Networking-Kit-WNHDEB111/dp/B00126R3P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NETGEAR HD/Gaming 5 GHz Wireless-N Networking Kit (WNHDEB111)</a>&nbsp;are not individually distinguishable. Only the mac address of the access point is identified therefore from my primary computer I cannot fully monitor a second PC or my NAS.

This version also includes registry cleaning as a component of the PC tune-up facility and ""identity safe security"" of personal information like social security, bank account and credit card numbers. The phishing filter is an improvement over version 1.0 however it still lacks the comprehensiveness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Site-Advisor-Plus-2009-1-User/dp/B001EJQTUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Site Advisor Plus 2009 1-User</a>&nbsp;in as much as it does not offer advice search engine results. Significantly, the phishing filter does not work with Safari or Google chrome.

And then there was the upgrade on my older PC...

In spite of Norton's representations, I would not recommend installation on any PC that meets only minimum system requirements. At every step, I encountered difficulties that severely constrained the process and after 24 man hours devoted to installation the process is still incomplete.

First and foremost, upgrade is not automatic. Although 360 offers three PC licensing, I could not download the upgrade via my existing account. Only after email inquiry was I provided  an address that facilitated download to my second and third PCs. In the instance of my oldest unit I made the mistake of running the recommended system scan before installation. It occurred to me as well, this does not generate a great deal of confidence in Norton if in fact one is upgrading or replacing an existing Norton anti-virus program. I received a message indicating this version was incompatible with Windows Defender so I had to remove that program before proceeding. I did not pre-scan with the other two PCs and no compatibility issues were identified nor I have experienced any since the upgrade or have I ever encountered issues in the two years I used 360 version 1.0.

Although during install procedure on my first computer I was advised existing add-on packs should be backed up using another program that must be downloaded from the Norton site, the same message was not received for either of the later installs and the add-on pack itself appeared on my desktop upon completion of the preliminary stages, but I get ahead of myself. The install aborted three times because LiveUpdate was running in the background and could not be terminated even manually via msconfig or the task manager. When I finally managed to disable it, I later discovered another version initiated by Norton Ghost could not be removed, so I had to uninstall Ghost before proceeding. Degradation of system performance was clearly evident as at least five hard stops were required and in each case the difference in boot times was visually perceptible without Norton running. Eventually, the install was completed but start up would not progress past the call to explorer.exe which was visible but the desktop icons were never painted...another hard stop via task manager and restart.

Finally, the configuration wizard appeared and I was able to setup the program...only to discover Norton had identified un-removable cookies,an un-repairable virus and my virus definitions from version 1.0 had not updated via LiveUpdate for more than 8 months. Following program instructions to contact online support for more information, I reached site catch 22 as the more information could not be gleaned until I defined the problem inhibiting installation...After removing the cookies with spybot and determining the virus was most likely Norton Ghost LiveUpdate, and  running a new version of LiveUpdate for more than two hours to acquire all of the missed updates, I received an email from support advising I should download a software removal tool to wipe out any residue programs, which of course would also wipe out my latest install and render 14 hours of effort pointless.

So now, I have version 2.0 installed and running with significantly greater degradation than version 1.0 as it applies to response time for Explorer or Firefox so I'm using Safari as the default browser and it performs with blazing speed even on this under resourced box with Norton installed. Of course...my install of Microsoft Office suite has been damaged so I have time to type this on another computer while I wait for the re-install to finish..."
0.5,"At work, we just got the newest version of Microsoft Office with Windows 2007 update; I have to say that it is the worst and most confusing program I have seen. Word perfect is good for anyone who is familiar with the original Microsoft Office. It's compatible, almost exact in the interface and easy to use right out of the box, without having to read a manual. My only complaint is its price. Word Perfect Office offers an alternative to Microsoft Office, but it isn't cheaper. Unfortunately, most major institutions update their Microsoft, which means that you will need to learn the new office to be a viable candidate in our contemporary job market. However, for regular home use, Word perfect is a great and easy to use program with lots of great features."
1,"I have used in the past MacAfee and AVG antivirus software, I have always struggled to use them as they have multiple add-ons you have to buy and install depending on what area you want to be safe in (though common sense dictates if I use a computer and buy an anti-virus I expect to be safe everywhere when using my computer)

I had the opportunity to grab a copy of Norton 360 and I am very glad I did. Norton 360 is exactly what an anti-virus software needs to be and offers protection in all areas of your computer. Last year I got a Toshiba Satellite that included Windows Vista (which is a pain already) and a trial version of MacAfee, I never understood how to optimize the use of the MacAfee application, it had too many windows and you had to upgrade different things at different times, I was relieved when the trial expired and I got to install a free application called AVG. AVG was good enough for what I needed but suffered from the same thing, 'if you want anti-spy ware you have to download and install this', 'if you want security using the internet install this other thing'...

I uninstalled AVG and installed Norton 360, first of all the installation was quick, it ran for over an hour (as I decided to have it scan my laptop while installing, if you decide not to it may take less time) Once I completed the setup and the application opened I went through the menus in one single screen which is great! The four areas in which the application is divided are in a single screen with submenus when you click over any of them, from this main menu you can scan, setup and even defragment your hard drive (the PC Tune-up feature helps optimize computer performance).  The time it has been installed in my laptop I have not noticed any slowness in performance and it has worked smoothly in the background while I surf the web or work in it.

One feature I liked is the 'Identity protection', in which you setup a profile with your personal info (including credit card number) and it will keep you safe when doing transactions online, you setup a password that Norton360 will require when doing transactions regardless of any security measures the web pages you use have. In my case I access my bank online to do transactions all the time and purchase from web sites, this feature serves as an additional security option. Norton360 also allows me to monitor my network and it even has functionalities that the software that came with my wireless router doesn't have!

Forget about buying antivirus software which makes you buy add-ons to feel safe, Norton360 has everything you need in one box."
0.5,"I switched to Win8 awhile back, and my go-to video editing software, Pinnacle Studio Ultimate 14, doesn't seem to appreciate the new operating system. I was thrilled to be able to try out Cyberlink PowerDirector, as it has consistently been winning against Pinnacle in head-to-head testing.

At first glance, the two programs have very similar appearance and ease-of-use within their full-feature editors. I found Pinnacle to be slightly easier to understand as far as being able to import folders and keeping different photos in those folders while I'm working on a project, otherwise both are equal in creating a photo-montage production, which is what I use this type of program for the most.

Cyberlink makes it easier to move things around the timeline in groups, so you can select a batch of images and drag them wherever. Pinnacle made it easier to copy and paste transition actions, but I think I'm just missing out on a quicker way to do it with Cyberlink.

Where PowerDirector really shines though is the wonderful Easy Editor and Slideshow Creator options. Honestly, these are so quick and simple that I think anyone could easily use them and create a good-looking video without any training whatsoever.

Pinnacle had issues with VERY slow rendering before you could burn a DVD, PowerDirector was able to render the same project in about half the time. Pinnacle also had issues with crashing when you'd get too complex with a bunch of different transitions and special effects within a project, PowerDirector seems more stable, although I was able to get it to crash once while trying to un-do a very resource-heavy process.

The freebies that come with PowerDirector are pretty neat also, free 20GB Cloud Service, access to DirectorZone, this gives you tutorials and tons of templates and other goodies. Fill out a survey and get even more freebies.

If you're trying to decide between PowerDirector Ultimate and Pinnacle Studio Ultimate, I definitely give the nod to PowerDirector."
0,Ghost doesn't seem to like to restore your image to any drive that isn't exactly partitioned the way the image was originally configured possibly only the original drive.  There may be logical reasons for this but I want more flexibility.  I now use Windows 7 image backup or Macrium Reflect for Windows Vista and prior.
0.5,"Having to write technical documentation and produce training material often requires me to grab dialog boxes and screen shots. Since ""Snagit"" is my company's (Fortune 500) only approved capture software, this is the tool we were given to use. As it turns out, it is the right software for the job! More than just a screen capture utility, Snagit lives up to its advertising by simplifying image/document retrieval and allowing for a wide range of export options.

Highly recommended!"
0.5,"With all the competing products out there, including the free version of AVG, it's tough to justify shelling out this kind of money for anti-virus software. Realizing that, McAfee has loaded this with extra features. My guess is most people will only use a small number of features beyond those that run automatically, but if you have use for the parental controls, data backup, shredder, or other extras, it might be worth getting this all in one package rather than installing several apps from different companies. All in all it's good software, even if the price seems a bit high."
-0.5,"I was happy to upgrade my corel version 12 to the new corel x4 and .to be honestly after 3 days of stragling with this new version I starting to give up ,it suck . the program crash many time for any change aplying affect's  to your work , or you  have to wait until 1 0r 2 minutes to screen set up and keep working with a proyect. complete dissaponted. better corel come up with a update solution to this problem and even adding up the memory  from 25 to 75 still pretty slow."
1,"I can't change the rating stars on this, so I will just preface my edited review instead.  My enthusiasm for this product would be total were it not for McAfee's inability to resolve a simple problem:  How to register the product so that the defense files would be updated regularly.

All that was accomplished after 5 separate sessions with McAfee Support was the exhaustion of my patience and the rising of my temper.

Go ahead and try this product, I still mean everything that I wrote below.  Maybe your version will install and register just fine.  My version won't and I'm returning the CD to McAfee.

==========================

Maybe I wouldn't be so enthusiastic about McAfee Total Protection 2008 if I hadn't had such a bad experience with Microsoft OneCare.  That said, for me... this product is everything that OneCare is NOT!  It's easy to install, taking only a few minutes on my Vista-powered machine and it nicely coexists with all of my software and peripherals, even to the point of finally (yes.. finally) making the network connection between my Sony Vaio notebook and my wife's iMac work.

How ironic is it that McAfee could coexist better with Vista than Microsoft's own product?

If you're confused by the disparity between various reviews of McAfee Total Protection 2008, I can't say as I blame you.  But in truth, that's the nature of the beast when it comes to personal computing these days.  Memory usage, processor speed and cache responsiveness will influence what works for you (and against you) while the guy next door working with a different configuration will get totally different results.  So with that in mind, here's a link to the PC that I installed this product on
a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-VAIO-VGN-N220E-B-15-4-Laptop-Intel-Pentium-D-T2060-1-6-GHz-Processor-1-GB-RAM-80-GB-Hard-Drive-DVD-RW-Drive-Vista-Premium-Black/dp/B000M5NJPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony VAIO VGN-N220E/B 15.4"" Laptop (Intel Pentium D T2060 1.6 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, DVD RW Drive, Vista Premium) Black</a>.  You can decide for yourself it it's close to the configuration of your machine.

I've been using McAfee anti-virus protection for a few years now so that was a no-brainer.  But the spyware protection and anti-phishing functions are great.  Total Protection gives me instant validation of some of my spam-related fears, preventing me from letting my curiosity lead me down an internet rabbit hole.

Whereas OneCare could never seem to coexist with my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Linksys-WRT54GS-Wireless-G-Broadband-Router-with-SpeedBooster/dp/B0001D3K8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Linksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBooster</a>, McAfee practically kissed the router on the cheek and got on with its business.

The first backup that I performed with Total Protection not only went smoothly, but I was able to back up documents, music and a ton of jpeg images to a flash drive with an almost unbelievable compression ratio, leaving plenty of room to spare.  Uh... OneCare not only could back up the same data to that drive, it couldn't allow me to change the destination, hosing up mid-backup.

Another function that seemed to get superior results was in the Registry cleanup.  Keep in mind, I just used OneCare to ""clean"" registry three months ago.  That said, Total Protection found plenty of things to fix and remove, and I have better system performance to show for it.

Last but not least, I like the ability to digitally ""shred"" confidential files.  Any CSI or Law and Order viewer knows that no computer file is ever truly clean of deleted files but with Total Protection I feel much, much more secure.

Bottom line... for me, Microsoft OneCare was definitively NOT the answer.  McAfee Total Protection 2008 DEFINITELY WAS!"
1,"The new WinZip has been upgraded with a variety of useful features. Installation was quick and easy. WinZip has been the consumer standard for compression, and they have branched out and separated the software into various editions including a Courier for email, a self extractor, utilities malware protection and so on. This review covers the standard edition, WinZip 17. This standard has a lot of great new features that make it more useful than ever. WinZip can now convert doc, docx (Word files), xls, xlsx (Excel files) and ppt, pptx (PowerPoint files) by selecting the Convert to PDF box in the Create tab and simply dragging your document into the work area. That alone is fantastic. By selecting options beforehand, you can encrypt your files (Winzip wipes and deletes any temporary files so they cannot be recovered, great protection option). You can right click and create zip files straight from Windows Explorer, sort columns by clicking on headers, processes files such as RAR, 7Z, ISO, IMG, BZ2, BZ, TBZ,TBZ2, TAR, Z, GZ, TGZ, LZH, LHA, CAB, UUencode, BinHex & MIME files. There are even iOS & Android apps for Apple & Google devices. You can resize images (great for compressing large photos). You can even add Watermarks to your Files with the extensions of BMP, GIF, JPG, PDF, PNG and TIF. The toolbars are very easy to use and are context sensitive, adapting to the task you are working on. Another great new feature is sharing with your social media accounts. You can post any type of file to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn with ZipShare. You can also send large files up to 2GB from your email account with ZipSend.  For me the best new feature is the access to cloud files. WinZip will connect to Dropbox, SkyDrive, Box and Google Drive. You can save a ton of space by zipping files to your cloud accounts or extracting to them. File compression can be customized to your specifications and is quick and fast. I love being able to convert documents to quick PDFs (no it doesn't have the features of Acrobat or Create PDF, but it gets the job done if you need an Office document converted to share or send). The Cloud integration is excellent. Just link WinZip to the service or services you use and you can zip or extract to them in a few minutes. WinZip makes the setup for this a breeze. This is particularly good for large size files or photos since extra space costs $$. I have used WinZip before and this new edition is the best ever. While many complain about the cost, WinZip is really an excellent product. I have tried several other compression programs like 7Zip (shareware) and Power Archiver. 7Zip for me is a great hassle. We have it at work and it is useless because even though it is installed on some machines, co-workers have a difficult time opening files so I never use it. When we had WinZip, everything ran smoothly. It may not be the most advanced compression option, the Pro Version has more advanced features, but it is certainly the easiest to use and the new features make it worth it. Connection  to the Cloud drives and quick PDF conversion are the features I use most often and it is fast and easy. There is also plenty of help available if needed and you can right click for more options. I highly recommend WinZip 17, Corel has stepped up their game for usefulness. A new must have."
-0.5,"There are so many frustrating bugs that I'm considering giving up on even tracking my finances with this kind of software.  The investing reports give random and useless values.  Transfer transactions cannot be deleted.  It crashes regularly. And often when I shut it down, it leaves files locked so that I have to reboot before I can run it again.

Considering that they add no noticeable enhancement each year, it seem that even a slightly competent development team could have fixed these issues by now.  I can only imagine that everyone at intuit is completely apathetic."
0.5,"This is the full version of Windows 7, so chances are you're looking at it because you are building a new computer and plan on putting this on it.  If you're wanting to upgrade your old XP or Vista computer and start from scratch, it's not like the old days where you could only format by using a full version.  Save yourself some money and purchase the upgrade version:  it will still offer you the ability to do a ""clean"" install and jettison the old Windows baggage.

I HIGHLY recommend you stop by Microsoft's website and look the different versions over to confirm you have the right one.  If you're running a computer old enough that you're upgrading from Windows 98 or Windows 2000, I don't recommend it:  your performance will drop and you'll see compatibility problems, some of which may be major.  If this is the case, stop by the Microsoft site, grab their ""Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor"", and run it first.

That said, Windows 7 Home Premium is probably the best bet for the average home user.  Unlike XP Home, which made basic things like networking a pain, or Vista Home, which really seemed to only be missing some eye candy, 7 Home Premium truly is aimed at the everyday consumer.  What you are missing when you pass on the Pro and Ultimate versions of 7 are:

Pro gives you:
1) complex networking made simpler (for example, connecting to AD domains and/or interacting with your workplace/corporate networks)
2) ""XP Mode"" - which runs a program within a virtual version of XP.  All versions of Windows 7 still have the ability to use ""XP Compatibility Mode"", which fools your programs into thinking they're running in XP, but the ""XP Mode"" feature of 7 Pro and Ultimate is an honest-to-god XP shell that runs within Windows 7.  Your hardware will also need to support ""Virtualization Technology"" in order to take advantage of this, otherwise this feature won't work.
3) Automated backup (which can be done using free tools if you'd rather save the money).

Ultimate also adds:
4) ""BitLocker"" Hardware-level encryption (your hardware will need to have a ""Trusted Platform Module (TPM)"" to support this or it won't work)
5) Native multi-language support:  which means you switch from one language to another on the fly and need to make things easier on yourself than they were when you used the Language Bar in XP or Vista

If you're a typical home user, chances are you'll be perfectly happy with Windows 7 Home Premium.  If you're an avid gamer who often has to rig that favorite game *just so* in order to get it to run, you might consider Windows 7 Pro to ease your headaches.  Ditto if for some reason you have a lot of older ""barely XP compatible"" programs that you think might be completely unable to function in just ""XP Compatibility Mode""--again, this is where the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, downloadable from Microsoft, can help you out (more on this in a moment).  You might also consider checking user forums for the program to see if anyone else has an answer.

I'm running Windows 7 Home on what was a risky upgrade: a Dell Inspiron 8200 that I've hacked to the Dell Precision D50 BIOS (to get an nVidia Quadro4 500 GoGL to work).  I realize that's a mouthful, and it did take some tinkering to get it upgraded properly. Between this machine's 7 Home Premium, and the Pro and Ultimate versions I have on other machines, I've been very happy with Home Premium:  thus far my XP programs run smoothly without having to fiddle with them, and I think I've actually picked up a bit of a performance gain from it.

If you're putting this on a new computer that you want to use to replace an older computer, you will be happy to know that you can migrate all your old stuff from one machine to another.  Search Microsoft for ""Windows Easy Transfer"":  this program will let you migrate just the user accounts and settings to the new machine very simply.  If you want to take it a step further--for example, you have a lot of programs on the old machine you don't want to have to sit down and reinstall one by one on the new machine--you can migrate all of them for $19.95 using Laplink PC Mover:  Amazon and the Laplink website are currently offering a special version that is just designed to migrate one computer to Windows 7 one time.  Read the documentation very carefully and keep a copy of it handy as I've no room to go into detail on that here.

So what are some of the things Microsoft doesn't tell you in the description above?

Windows 7 isn't just ""fixed Vista"":  it's a full overhaul of Windows based on a ton of feedback collected directly from Beta and RC 1 users (of which I was one--I let them have an earful and I think they actually listened)

Windows 7 does things drastically different from XP in that, like Vista, it does a lot of the eye candy in a smoother way.  XP and earlier used to send graphics work through your processor before it'd get to your video card...now, it bypasses the processor and goes straight to the video, clearing up what was a pretty substantial bottleneck.  This system was imperfect (to say the least!) in Vista, but it's been improved here, particularly in the area of being compatible with older games

Windows 7 is trying to slowly ""trim the fat"" we normally have to put up with by making itself more compatible with other devices.  Where you typically have to install a new device by running the manufacturer's setup disc, installing a bunch of junk and tray icons, and etc., Microsoft is making native support more common in 7.  My sound card, for example, used to need about 5 or 6 ""helper"" programs that would drain my performance and occasionally annoy me.  Now it's just using the drivers that came with the installation of 7.

Now, if you *are* upgrading, here are some very important things you need to know:

1) There are two types of upgrade: ""in-place"" (where a Vista machine upgrades to 7 and you get to keep all your programs) and ""clean"" (where you lose all your old programs and settings).
2) Anyone going from XP to 7 will have to go ""clean"".
3) Anyone going from a different Vista to 7 (for example, Vista Home up to 7 Pro, or Vista Ultimate down to 7 Home) will also have to go ""clean"".

If you have to do 2) or 3), all is not lost--I'll explain in a moment.

Before you even buy a 7 upgrade for your machine, stop by Microsoft's website for two things:

a) download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, as mentioned above. Run it with every device connected to the machine that you'll ever want to use in 7. It'll thoroughly examine your machine for any roadblocks and give you good advice about upgrading. Even very new machines will have one or two programs that need some checking.
b) Go to the Windows 7 Compatibility Center and double-check anything that came up negative in the Upgrade Advisor (or didn't show up at all). This site lists detailed compatibility info on a LOT of different devices and even lets you select between 32-bit and 64-bit.

Anything critical to the operation of the machine, like a video card or sound card driver, I'd recommend double-checking with the manufacturer's website to be sure. This almost burned me on the Dell I mentioned above--the video driver was approved in the Upgrade Advisor but failed the Compatibility Center check.  Going to the manufacturer's website let me get my hands on a driver that I could apply after the install.

c) Last, make a backup on another hard drive. There's a free tool called Macrium Reflect that can do this for you.

Do you have to do a ""clean"" install, but just want to carry over your user accounts and settings? Microsoft's Windows Easy Transfer (also mentioned above) is already insatlled on a Vista machine (and XP users can download it from Microsoft). Easy Transfer will export your accounts and settings and let you import them back again. It's very easy to use and does a good job of putting your accounts back together again, even going from XP to 7.

Do you have to do the ""clean"" install, and you don't want to reinstall all your programs? Use the Laplink PC Mover Windows 7 Upgrade Edition to upgrade.  Each purchase of this special edition will do one machine one time. Read the documentation in detail:  the steps are rahter easy, but they're also rather important to get right the first time.

The most important thing to doing a ""clean"" install and keeping your programs and settings is that in the Upgrade setup you choose ""Custom"". Windows will take all of your major files and place them in a folder called ""Windows.old"". PC Mover and the Easy Transfer program will use this folder to reconstruct your system from, so this is VERY important.

New Operating Systems are always a bumpy road:  your journey might not be as easy as others.  However, compared to previous Windows releases, Windows 7 is a substantial improvement, and I'm pleased to say that I haven't been burned by 7 like I was with Vista (and Windows Me--agh, the horror, the horror).  If you just want to get yourself onto the 7 platform and don't need a lot of customization, Windows 7 Home is a great place to start."

1,"Nolo does an excellent job in bringing together over 100 contracts forms.  From buying goods to selling goods they have you covered. More importantly the type of business type you plan to form. Knowning if you are going to be a partnership, a LLC, or an independent contractor and the legal agreement you should have in place is important. However, there still may be some confusion, so you should the advice or a lawyer. Also the internet is your friend but of course be carefull of misinformation.

Creating document are easy.  Open the document you wish to create, answer the questions you are presented with and your document is done.

The software also includes multiple forms. Including various policy documents for when your business grows a little larger and you need to start implement various employee policies.  There are employee agreements, non-compete clauses, NDA, and various tax forms.

There are 5 ebooks included to help you business plans, loans, legal guide, employment law, and tax information.

This is a must have software for anyone just starting out in business. It is invaluable but as I have already stated you still should be hiring outside legal help.

0,"I have been a beta tester for awhile now and all I can say is where is the ' next generation ' os ? Yes it looks nice but thats just window dressing.... The 4 flavors option is dumb.

the best way to upgrade is to buy a new hard drive and do a separate install - do not buy the ' upgrade ' version it will kill your XP license!! If your not going to change your motherboard anytime soon then buy the OEM version (available at newegg or other build it yourself sites) this version is tied to your motherboard and will not transfer but who cares because your gonna save like 130 bucks.

This one license stuff is troubling - this price should include at least 2 or 3 licenses. Very disappointing."

They recommend removing the previous antivirus protection before installing. total installation and update time was a little under 10mins on a new HP laptop. Updates can be 4 times a day or a customized single time that you choose and are automatic. I love that this gives me two years of protection instead of 1 year like the competetors. I was also comforted that it didn't slow down my laptop down at all like my previous mcafee security seemed to do. Overall, I am very pleased and would recommemed the subscription."

1,"Here is a gem of a sketching software that is super clean in design interface, highly intuitive and low resource consuming (Autodesk..please keep it that way!). I have previously been using Fractal Design Expression, but I really like this program. There are enough tools for executing sketches and drawings of great complexity. I wish there was more utility with handling the layers feature such as layers combine. Also, more options with the color palette like Correl Paint's would be nice. Otherwise, a super nice program for beginners and light users. Wacom Bamboo pen response is very good for this kind of lower priced program (although it takes a bit of getting used to drawing and switching settings on the bottom left). The program allows the use of a mouse but you don't get the pressure sensitivity and drawing precision it. I will be using it extensively for engineering sketches to communicate with my customers.

0.5,"Corel have been in this particular game for some time and I've been using several of the previous versions of this software to create, edit and sometimes upload film clips that I've put together for differing reason with this software.

This isn't supposed to be a PC equivalent to Mac's Final Cut Pro or even Adobe's Premiere software, it is specifically intended for consumer / and sometimes pro-sumer users. I would hedge on the use of the word 'pro-sumer' as I imagine that might only happen in an emergency or quick fix.

My experience with this software is entirely positive. I find it easy to use, easy to edit and simple to navigate to interface. Everything has a learning curve, as does this, so my only advice is that if you're new to editing and this is what you're using, then take your time, be patient and spend time understanding what the features do.

Corel provides a plethora of information on using the software and their are literally hundreds of Youtube tutorials where people are giving hasty lectures and demonstrations doing basic work all they way to very specific tasks.

My only complaint would be the rendering / processing time is still lengthy. I know these times have been dramatically shortened over the years with more powerful PC's, but having to wait several hours to verify my work, can be a bit draining -- especially when you've already been up late editing.

That said, this program is a WYSIWYG style of editor and is incredibly simple to use. The layered features make it more than just a basic feature so it's worth spending the time to get familiar with the program."

0,"The on-line ""live"" aspect of this program provided through ""Bing"" is much better than the program that comes on the disk.  The ""Bing"" maps will show names of malls, manufacturing plants, and other data that most on-line maps ignore.  How many times have I tried to find a mall, or a restaurant on my navigator, only to come up empty handed? Well, there is it on Bing!

The PC program itself is not what I hoped. It was not very intuitive; I could easily turn ""on"" the boxes to show points of interest and such, but how do I turn them off?  How can I make the boxes bigger? They were very tiny. It's not obvious.  I like being able to create and save my own ""push pins,"" and even customize what they look like somewhat, but when I wanted to delete one created in error, there was no clear way to do that.  Also, attempts to make the map opening larger all failed. There was a lot of blank space at the bottom of the window I couldn't get rid of.

I haven't tried the GPS tracking. That might be useful, but as of yet, I'm not sure how. I would have to take my computer with me to see how the GPS feature works.  Obviously, the GPS feature is NOT for a home PC, but for a laptop or similarly portable computer.

After that, it bacame mostly invisible.  I haven't noticed any performance issues, and have been been pleased with this product.

Also comes with Internet Explorer 8 which crashes all the time.  Must reboot the computer every morning due to some security patch download - which takes forever to shutdown & install.

0,"Turbotax is usually seamless, but not so this time.  It has trouble reading online bank accounts and investments, resulting in some rather large numerical errors.  Maybe the upgrades before tax time will resolve the issues; one can only hope.

0.5,"I've always used Photoshop for my raster images and Visio for my vector diagrams, so I'm used to the notion of different tools for different tasks and I'm aware that any tool will have its strengths & weaknesses. CorelDRAW X5 is a decent low-cost alternative for vector drawings, but definitely not a replacement for Photoshop.

I'm happy with CorelDRAW, but a couple of things have made me say ""hmmm"".

The installation is HUGE.  The installer said that it was going to take a little more than 5GB, but I had just checked my drive space before the install and it seems like it took closer to 7GB.  It took a long time to install, so I don't want to uninstall/reinstall just to verify the numbers.

For some reason I've always been a little creeped out by Corel's EULAs (the legal gobbledygook you have to accept before installing). I don't typically read every word of of the EULA, but for some reason Corel's license agreements have always caught my attention. I'm not crazy about the notion that the application can check my system whenever it wants and report usage statistics at will and re-validate the license.

The packaging and the splash screen also make me uneasy in the way that they repeat over and over that this product is for home use only.  Even the application's title bar nags you:  ""CorelDRAW X5 (Not for commercial use) - [Untitled-1]"".  Before I installed it on my laptop I was really tempted to load it on my PC at work just to see if the black helicopters would come get me.  My wife wanted me to make up a sign for a garage sale, but I told her that would technically be ""commercial"" and that I was afraid the app would somehow detect my deceit and chop off my mouse finger.

Anyway, aside from some of these weird cosmetic issues, it's a good tool for drawing. If you're not familiar with the CorelDraw family, there are plenty of resources included with the installation DVD. The PDF ""Guidebook"" is very well written and nicely presented.  If you're going to print it and use it as a desktop reference, maybe buy a new ink cartridge first, because it's very richly formatted with lots of colors.  They really did a nice job with the documentation.

There is also a user community at their website, which is a great way to get some backup support.

All in all, the functionality is very decent for the price.  There are also additional utilities included on the disc, like Corel Photo-Paint (similar to PaintShop Pro).

If you're looking for a low-cost graphics solution (as opposed to the Adobe Creative Suite of apps), then Corel is worth considering. But if you already have a background with any of the Adobe suite, then maybe consider the comparably-priced Adobe ""Elements"" applications."
1,I'm a longtime satisfied Norton user.
1,"I chose this program for my daughter who has taken to anime and Pixar and was curious to how animation works.

It's called a debut program and I found it offers a rather decent set of tools to play with animation.  However, it's not geared towards children as there is a lack of wizards to guide a person through the tools.  There is a PDF and I found it would not keep my girls interest in playing with the package.

The program is fun and does make my girl laugh when I make it do things or show her how but interest can be lost by the PDF and playing by trail and error if your child can get easily frustrated and or bored.

Once nice thing is there are installers for both the Mac and Windows.  I have installed it on Tiger and Win 7 and have not seen any issues so far.  There is an upgrade to version 6.2.  However, it is mildly annoying to have to re-enter the serial number after applying the update so don't loose the serial number.

Overall, this is a good introduction to animation but it does take a little effort to learn especially if the user is young."
1,Have been using TurboTax for years.  It is great for business taxes.  I feel very confident in preparing my own taxes.
-0.5,"Every time I get a new Quicken program, it is worse than before. Literally. I would go back to the 1990's versions if I could!
I honestly don't understand what those Quicken programmers are up to. I think they just need to tinker with it constantly to justify getting more money for forced upgrades. But they are really downgrades.
There are many features I miss from 15 years ago!
I was forced to ""up"" grade to this version so I could get downloaded quotes and transactions from my broker. That is the ONLY reason I bought this. Intuit is a rip off company. Why no one competes with them is beyond me. They could get a heck of a lot of customers switching from Intuit. Maybe Intuit bumps them off before they can develop anything.

Quicken 2012 ""downgrades"":
1. The ""find"" function in the register no longer automatically chooses the field that the cursor is in, but does ""all fields"" as the default, creating the need for more mouse clicks than before.

2. No longer can do a simple report based on the vendor in the field the cursor is in but have to go to a long menu instead, again necessitating more mouse clicks than before.

3. Got rid of the choice to automatically edit the split of a transaction to the same percentage as the last transaction of that vendor. So now you have to use a calculator to figure it out yourself. More time wasted.

4. Tax report to Turbo Tax closes Quicken

5. Much slower quote downloads. MUCH SLOWER.

Also, there is no W2 report. So why bother letting us track W2's with all the various deductions, taxes, etc? This has never existed that I know of.

I wish Intuit would read this: get a real job! Quit making Quicken worse every year. Stop your monopolizing practices. You used to be a good company when you were small in your basement when you first started. Now you are just greedy jerks."

0.5,"It's really kind of hard for me to evaluate PSP X8 fairly because I find I'm always comparing it to Painter 2016.  I use the latter a lot, the former... it simply doesn't do as much as either Painter, or Photoshop Effects.  And that's fine, considering the vast difference in price points between it and the others.  It's at the low end of the image manipulation range, and for that reason alone it deserves kudos, so let's talk about it from that point of view.

This is a program the average user is going to love having.  It does a heck of a lot of cool stuff to your photos.  There's a quick adjust tab which includes a lot of very basic fixes like noise removal, vibrancy, brightness and contrast and the like.  The edit tab takes things a few steps further with resizing, photo effects, cropping, and even layers.  It's a fairly sophisticated package for the home user, and if the effects aren't as finely tuned, as in a more expensive program, or the controls aren't as easy to master, it's really a small thing for the value you're getting

I can tell you that it works just fine in Windows 10 on my laptop, though it's a bit slow.  Again, not a huge problem compared to the value you're getting.  My best advice to you is to figure out what it is you'd want to use an image program for and buy accordingly.  If you're simply not sure, then start with PSP and see if you strain its abilities.  If so, you can always move up."
0.5,Good MS office alternative.

0,"Okay, everybody needs to open and save documents in the various office formats.  But there are a lot of options right now: you can dual-boot into windows, or run windows in a VM such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VMware-Fusion-2/dp/B001F5VBRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VMware Fusion 2</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parallels-Desktop-4-0-for-Mac/dp/B001K6OEV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parallels Desktop 4.0 for Mac</a>.  You can use OpenOffice, which is a free open source office suite.  or, of course, you can run the MS Office suite on your Mac sans-windows using Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac.

Personally, I do need to use Word and PowerPoint and Excel both at home and at work, and it's especially nice to have a native app, because I don't like running a VM if I don't have to (maybe if my laptop were newer I wouldn't mind letting a VM run idle all the time, but I so rarely use it that it seems silly).  Also, VM's tend to drain batteries on laptops, so I like to avoid using one when I'm not plugged in to the wall.  Interestingly, I often needed something other than Office 2007 for Windows because everyone else in the world had upgraded past 2007, and 2007 doesn't open the newer .docx file formats without downloading converters ... I've used Apple's Pages, Apple's TextEdit, and Sun's OpenOffice and of course MS Office 2008 for Mac.  To make a long story short: there are a lot of options and I've tried them all.  So read on:

FEATURES: Just what you'd expect: every feature, button, option, pallet, style, etc is available.  They're also very accessible (not a UI masterpiece, but since we've all been trained to the Office UI since birth, you'll be able to find everything you need). 5 stars.

FILE COMPATIBILITY: No problems that I've found.  Yet.  I'd used older Office:Mac versions and never ran into file formatting issues there either, so I'll give the benefit of the doubt that I'll have a similar experience.  Especially considering that MS now uses a fairly well documented xml file format (hence the new 'x' at the end of all your file names).  5 stars.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE: Launches fairly quickly, works well, scrolls smoothly, etc.  Overall the app performs to the standards you'd expect. A bit slow opening large files (I wrote a 340 page book - and it opened in a little under 20 seconds.  In fact you should buy it, just for reference ;-)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cluck-Murder-Most-Fowl/dp/1419682644/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cluck: Murder Most Fowl</a>&nbsp;... anyway - 4 stars.

PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY: Here I have a major complaint.  I'm running a MacBook Pro with a 2.33GHz Core 2 Duo, and 2GB of RAM.  I'm a computer guy, I work for an information security company, I keep things patched and updated and running clean ... and ever since installing this, my system has been running slower.  I should have known better than to provide an admin password during install, as there's no reason that an office suite needs that level of access.  When Word or PowerPoint is running, it seems to get worse.  There are always 2 Microsoft processes running, one of which consumes about 2% of my CPU no matter what.  This is bearable overall, but it earns the product a 1-star rating for this category.

DOCUMENT DESIGN: Just in case anyone is looking for Word to create flyers and such, I want to say that if you are, look elsewhere.  Word is notoriously bad at formatting anything other than text-based documents.  If you own a Mac and need these types of features, get&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iWork-09/dp/B0014X2UAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iWork '09</a>&nbsp;and use Pages, which is great at creating vivid and lively brochures, resumes, menus, etc.  I'm not providing a star rating for this category, because Word should never be evaluated in this category by a Mac user (and this is Office for Mac, after all).

ENTOURAGE: A decent enough mail app, but again, why not just use Mail?  It comes with your Mac, and in about three months from now (in Sep 2009) Mail will support the few remaining Exchange features that Entourage can handle (and even entourage doesn't handle exchange accounts that well, IMO).  So again, no star rating here: only use entourage if your IT guy makes you. Wait, this is the Home & Student edition, so unless you're Bill Gates, you aren't running an exchange server in your home.  And if your school is running exchange, transfer.  Quickly.

OVERALL the product works, and the minor inconvenience of slowing things down will probably go unnoticed (or less noticed) on newer Macs than mine.  However, this flaw is largely responsible for bringing a 4.5 star overall rating down to 3 stars."
0.5,"I'm kind of a personal computer security freak.  It seems I've tried everything out there at least once: Norton/Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro, Zone Alarm, Avast, Kaspersky, etc.  I'll compare this product to the ones I have come across.

In terms of user friendliness, I give this product a 4.5/5.  It's visually oriented, without any complex menus and submenus to deal with.  Reminds me of Norton and McAfee in terms of the ability to quickly access what you need to get done with the program.

When it comes to your machine, handling this program, it's a 4/5.  It's definitely not as lightweight as McAfee, Trend Micro, or Avast, but it's way easier on your memory and hard drive than the infamous destructive force ""I need a new computer b/c my anti-virus program destroyed it"" Norton or the ""I'm afraid of my next door neighbor hacking into my computer"" Kaspersky users.

In terms of personal security, this program is really the works: antivirus, firewall, spam, spyware.  I give it 3.5/5.  It has a wide variety of things it monitors, but as often is the case with such products, the more you spread out your resources, the fewer bugs you catch.  In terms of variety of options, yet lack of a sophisticated and comprehensive database of bugs, this reminds me of McAfee, Avast, Trend Micro, Zone Alarm.

So, to finish off, see where you fit in:

If you are regular computer user, who doesn't go to ""iffy"" web site, doesn't download things from ""iffy"" sources, this is really an excellent program for you, especially for the money.  If you don't like this program for some reason, I'd recommend Trend-Micro, Avast (which is free but not nearly as comprehensive), or McAfee.

If you are constantly under threat from viruses/worms/hackers/spyware and want an extremely powerful and comprehensive program designed by a certified genius that will basically allow you to control every 1 and 0 that comes into your computer, you have the time to set it up and maintain properly, and you have an extremely powerful computer that can handle it, get the Kaspersky Security Suite.

I wouldn't recommend Norton to even my worst enemy.  Because it's the most popular program worldwide, virus makers and hackers love to target it with all sorts of new things, basically shutting down the program before it can even protect you (great, huh?).  And not to mention, that this program buries into your hard-drive so far down, that not even a professional can't salvage your computer from the damage (i.e. slowing your computer down), Norton causes after you uninstall it.  I beg you, if you are thinking of getting a new PC, DEMAND from the computer manufacturer that you DO NOT get a pre-installed free trial of Norton on your computer which is all too often the case as Symantec tries to purposefully dominate the market with its ""superior"" product."
0.5,"I'm a computer software person, but I don't have a lot of experience with editing photographs beyond occasionally playing around with a new software package for fun. I got this as a review copy, and I had fun using it to edit a bunch of photographs from a trip I took to an NFL training camp.

I was surprised by how rich the feature set was, given the price point this is at compared to some other software that I've tried. The explanations of some of its features aren't quite as clear as I'd have liked, but they certainly do make an effort to offer plenty of information on how it all works.

For budget photo editing software, this is an excellent option. For people who just want to occasionally resize or crop an image, this is a lot more complicated than what you need."

I installed the program on a Windows 7 machine and it went smoothly.  The program installs a little Windows widget for easy access to your media.

The image and video editors are basic, but work.  The main issue I have is that Picasa and Windows Movie Maker do the same thing, both of which are available for free.

0.5,"Microsoft Office 2007 was a radical departure from the previous versions of Office:  it introduced an XML-based file format that changed files like "".doc"" and "".xls""  to "".docx"" and "".xlsx"".  More importantly, it heavily modified the user interface, changing the old way of menus to the new ""Ribbon Control"" with tabs and context-sensitive icons.

This is the Professional version of Office:  it contains Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Access and Publisher.  The Home & Business Edition subtracts Publisher and Access and the Home Edition further subtracts Outlook.

Dude, Where's my Stuff?
While Office 2010 isn't as radical a departure as 2007 was, it is definitely different.  Users who have just gotten used to the Ribbon Control may be exasperated to find that once again features have been moved.  Gone is the circular ""Office"" button that used to be your access point for things like saving and printing--the ""File"" menu is back...but not quite.  The User Interface has been tweaked to provide more visible work surface, and yet there are now tabs in the ribbon that completely hide the work surface.  For example, the ""File"" menu will open a web-page-style layout that covers the entire window:  it offers basic menu items on the left, some large-button categorical options in the middle, and then refreshes the huge space on the right with large buttons for the basic features.  Instead of menus and sub-menus it is now more like navigating a web site.
Then there's the verbiage.  For example, ""Send...as e-mail attachment"" is now performed by choosing ""Save & Send"" on the left, then ""Send Using E-mail"" in the middle, and ""Send as Attachment"" on the right.
After a little bit of time looking at the Office 2010 Ribbon and Menus, you'll start to understand exactly what's been done to Office this time around.  Microsoft have added a huge ton of features, and then tried to put all of those as close to the navigation surface as possible.  In other words, you'll no longer be clicking *deep* into the menus, you'll be making one or two clicks and then looking at all the options that are dumped on your screen to pick which one you'll be using.  To make matters more confusing, some options (such as ""Save"" or ""Open"") drop you off the File Menu, give you the typical Open/Save dialog box you are used to, and then automatically select the ""Insert"" tab and show you the work surface before you finish making your selection.  It can get very distracting.

Return of the Feature Creep
In the past whenever Office bolted on new items (such as blogging), the typical way of dealing with it was to give you toolbars that you could show, hide, and drag around to arrange at the top of your screen.  Now what we have is:
- Tab names at the top that come and go based on what you're doing (like Office 2007)
- Changes to the workspace based on which tab you've selected
- A File Menu that is no longer a candy-like button but is another tab on the ribbon...and yet it drops every possible option onto the screen and trusts you to navigate through them.

Tuned and Tweaked
That said, Microsoft have done something under the covers that has been a blessing and a curse.  On the one hand, your programs will load lightning-quick.  On the other, if you try to keep two installations of Office on the same machine, what is supposed to work will instead work unevenly:  Word and Excel will let you open both versions, but my installations of Outlook and Project completely blocked my ability to launch the 2007 versions (despite repeatedly indicating otherwise during installation and configuration).

Future Forecast:  Bright, but Cloudy
The other feature Office 2010 places more at the forefront is the idea of The Cloud.  In Office-Speak, this means using the Internet to keep documents synced in real-time no matter where you go.  If you remember Windows Briefcase, this is everything the Briefcase should have been.  If you ever tried the File Sync Wizard, Windows Sharing and Synchronization, or ActiveSync, this is like an invisible, hands-free version of that.  There's good and bad about this and you want to be aware of what it entails before you get involved.  For example, you can create a new file and choose ""Store on Web"" or ""Save to Web"".  When you do this, you will be prompted to choose the location.  If that location is a Windows Live account, then you'll want to pay attention to whether you are saving to a private folder or a public one.  From that point forward, any time you open the document on any machine it can fetch the latest version from the web.  If you don't want your document to sync automatically it can also be done manually.

If you're used to Microsoft Office 2007, you will be impressed with Office 2010's addition of features and its performance as a program.  Expect to be frustrated from time to time when something appears to have `moved'.  If you're new to the revised Office system of 2007 and 2010, it is a complete look-and-feel overhaul and you will want to spend some time getting to know it."
0.5,"I have been running Kaspersky Pure since version 1.0. I bought a pack of 3-year licenses which led me through upgrades to 2.0 and recently to 3.0. My overall experience with Kaspersky has been favorable; that said, it has presented some challenges along the way. My experience probably would be different had I installed fresh every time, rather than upgrade.

When Pure 3.0 was released I received an upgrade notice and I immediately downloaded the new version. Then, I kicked off the install without reading the instructions which ended up being a very bad mistake. The instructions state that other security suites, including previous versions of Pure, must be uninstalled first, a step I skipped. So, about 75% into the install the installer quit due to open files, leaving the install in an incomplete state. Worse, it corrupted the older version to a point that it could not be uninstalled, nor could 3.0 ever finish proper installation. The result was a system with a completely broken security install that could not be repaired. I am going to reimage that system shortly.

On a different system, I followed the install directions completely and the install was as smooth as could be. The lesson learned from this was to follow the directions, even if common sense says that it should uninstall older versions of itself. I could understand if it clashed with a competing product, but it should at least be smart enough to handle older versions of itself in such a way that the system is not left in a broken state.

Once Pure was properly installed, I have seen no issues. Other reviewers have stated that the product has a bad tendency to turn itself off, but I have not seen this with version 3.0 (though it was definitely an issue with 2.0). I am running Pure 3.0 on a Windows 7 64-bit system. There are enough others complaining of this issue to make it a concern and I have been watching for it but so far the product has remained stable and has not failed me. It's definitely something to keep in mind, though.

Pure 3.0 looks very much like version 2.0 and has pretty much the same feature set with a few additions. The application's main interface is a dashboard-style window with access to key features of the suite - backup, computer protection and parental control.

I have not used the backup functionality so I really cannot adequately talk to this feature, though I am glad to know it's there and may use it down the road. It allows for backing up important personal files such as movies, pictures and documents as well as defining a custom backup filter too. This is not a complete backup solution and is meant to be a way to back up critical data.

The computer protection section of the application provides access to the meat of Pure, including the scanning functions, firewall, anti-spam, anti-banner and more. All of these work together to provide a cleaner and safer computing experience. The two most critical functions, the scanner and the firewall, provide solid protection and so far have never let me down. I especially like the firewall which has passed every test I have been able to throw at it - port scans, file system access attempts and more.

The parental controls module is an important feature to me and so far I have been satisfied. I like that it allows for blocking out times when the network is accessible and it allows for category blocking which makes blocking whole classes of websites very easy. It errs on the side of caution and sometimes prevents access to websites that I regard as acceptable, and I would rather have that issue than have it allow access to objectional content online.

With the exception of the really bad installation issues I saw (which one could argue were my fault for not following directions), my experience with Pure 3.0 has been positive. It has been very stable and it has protected my system nicely. Going on my experience alone I would not hesitate to recommend Pure. Still, there are a number of others who have seen issues with the application turning itself off, enough so that it merits some consideration."
1,"PaintShop Pro was once referred to as the ""poor man's Photoshop"" for being feature rich while costing a fraction of the price of Photoshop.  If you can't afford Photoshop's heafty price tag, this is as close as you can get.  It has the ability to adjust channels and full masking capabilities, where Photoshop Elements is severely hobbled for the consumer market.  There are ways you can ""cheat"" at replicating some of the unincluded features of Photoshop in Photoshop Elements, but I loathe work arounds and just want a tool to be there when I need it.  Paintshop Pro 5X also offers a wider array of image file formats.  This is especially important if you work in a variety of programs or are collaborating on a project with someone else.  If you own Painter as well, you can send your Painter RIFF files over to PSP or do your prep work without a lot of back and forth conversions.

I do have a confession to make here, I am a Photoshop CS6 user--so why did I buy Paintshop Pro as well?  The aswer is that it offers a wide selection of filters and effects that Photoshop does not have.  Over the years we've been presented with the same, stale filter gallery in Photoshop version after version. There is only one new artistic filter (oil painting)in the currect iteration, but other than that it essentially has the same filters it had when I bought Photoshop 6 years ago. You can add 3D party plugins, but they are expensive; but when you buy Paintshop Pro X5 Ultimate you not only get the programs native filter set, (including the new Retro Lab), but you also get a large selection of Nik Color Effect filters and a free download of KPT Filters (which formerly cost a lot of money).  There are also decorative frames and Paint Tubes to mention just a few items. So the user has a lot of flexibility here, and the ability to grow from basic edits to more advanced work. With the ability to do different things than Photoshop, it gives me more options to use when creating pictures, but with it's wide array of file format acceptance the ability to go between programs more readily while preserving image integrity and layers.

The only con I have is that the program seems slightly unstable, but it is a fairly young release and I'm sure more update patches will follow.  If I did not have Photoshop I would chose PaintShop Pro X5 Ultimate Edition over Photoshop Elements any day.  It has a deeper feature set and allows for more growth than Photoshop Elements does, as well as image cataloging and sorting features."
1,"The ninth of the Nancy Drew Mystery Series. This is my favorite game, so I'm gonna go nuts here. Things are graded A-F, just like school.

The Crime: A +

Nancy tries to take another vacation, this time by spending some time on Katie Firestone's whale watching boat in Snake Horse Harbor. The minute she arrives, plans change! Katie's boat has been vandalized. An orphan orca has shown up in the bay and there are different opinions as to what to do with it. Did Katie's big mouth get her in trouble?

Suspects include fisherman Holt Scotto, cafe-owner Jenna Devlin, and rival whale watching tourguide Andy Jason.

I'd never had a chance to learn anything about whales or the ocean and thought this was an endlessly cool premise.

Puzzles: A +

Nancy has to figure out everything from nautical terms to knots to Morse code. People give her tasks and quizzes. It can be as easy as making a sandwich or as hard as traveling underground tunnels and counting rocks.

Gameplay: A +

This game has it all. You can spend time out on the water in a kayak, eat a bowl of hearty chowder (or maybe a blueberry muffin) in the Hot Kettle Cafe, read about the local sea monster, build sand castles on a remote beach and dig for clams in the sand.

The only thing missing is maybe romance. But you get to talk to Frank and Joe Hardy on the phone, so that's close enough. (I love those boys.)

Time Changes: None.

Voice Acting: A +

In a word, perfect.

Favorites -

""Ah. Nuts."" Andy Jason

""Next one'll be on the house, too."" Jenna Devlin

""Vote for Holt!"" Holt Scotto

Music: A +

I loved, loved, loved the music. The travel music was jaunty and perfectly fit the ambiance of the tiny seaside town. Especially cool was the little flute trill that occurred as you finished a puzzle.

Graphics/Video: A +

Getting better and better all the time. Bonus points for the animated sequences such as the whale watching tour.

Technical: B

I'm one of a few people who have had this problem, but no matter what I did, DDI wouldn't fully install on my computer. There was an error copying files and no matter what I did, it wouldn't fix it, even following HI's advice on the technical support board. Running the game from the disc rather than installing to my computer fixed the problem completely though.

Overall, I think this one is the pinnacle of HI's goodness.

If you love Nancy Drew, this one's for you. All-time favorite."
0.5,"Corel Painter Essentials is a wonderful entry level drawing and painting program. It is just plain fun to use. Even if you don't have a drawing tablet, you can still create a masterpiece. Select your color, select your brush and begin. The brush tool reminded me of tempra painting in kindergarten. The full wide brush strokes. Going over an existing line again, with a different paint color, to see how the blend looks. Results were just as good (or bad) as I remember them growing up.
If you prefer drawing to painting you can choose pen or charcoal.
You can scan sketches or photos and paint directly on them. You can even have the program automatically transform an imported picture into an oil painting, impressionist painting, watercolor sketch, pencil sketch or a chalk drawing. The included tutorials will show you how easy it is to transform and create beautiful works of art.
The program is easy to use. The auto transformations are useful and the results can be fantastic. The wide selection of tools and palettes will make almost anyone happy.
Definitely this is one program an art  hobbyist should have. Even a professional could find this program to be a useful tool - the results are astonishing. Enjoy!"
-0.5,"Dragon Dictate has been a somewhat frustrating experience.

This software came on a disc with no key to download, even though new Apple computers haven't had optical drives for some time now.  The software should be sold on a flash drive rather than on a disc and with a download included.

Installation was no problem after getting a disc drive.

Training was not a problem.  However, there is a bit of a learning curve with the commands and when using the software, it is necessary to actively give dictation, rather than to just speak.  When I have given verbal commands to a computer in the past, it was frustrating, and giving dictation just multiplies that into a continuous irritation.

The biggest problem is that the resulting documents are very error-ridden and really are more work to go back over and clean up than it would be to type them manually in the first place.

I can only recommend this software as useful for people who both need to make a record of their thoughts quickly and who can't type or for situations where there are large volumes of information to be dictated and a clean final document isn't important so a very rough draft is acceptable.

For me, it just isn't worth the bother."

I have been using TM for many years now, and I've never been disappointed with their products or their service. I highly recommend them if you're looking to step away from Norton, Mcaffee or the others."
1,"As a longtime Quicken user (8 years) and MicroSoft Money user (3 years) I was very disappointed when I switched to a Mac Pro last January (2009) and found no version of Money and the only available Quicken was a 2007 (pretty much unsupported and un-updated) product!

I refused to put a Windows OS on my new Mac - that would open the machine up to Windows virus attacks and other problems.

I tried ""Crossover"" which allowed me to use a Quicken for Windows program but did not require a Window OS.  That was ok but it was slow, a bit buggy, and there was no interface with ICal (so no easy alerts).

Then I found IBank!!

Not only did IBank work beautifully with my Leopard and Snow Leopard OS but it put dates and reminders into ICal with no problem.  I was very happy that it looked like a true Mac program instead of a Windows program.

Now, after 8 months of using IBank (the last version is 3.5.4) I can tell you honestly -- for my use as a home owner, on-line bill payer, watcher of credit card charges, and user of paperless monthly statements from 2 banks and 2 credit card companies -- I am VERY VERY HAPPY and please with IBank.

I highly recommend IBank!  You can use the full program for 30 days before you buy it OR you can buy it and return it for 100% money back if you do not find it to be what you need.

Amazon offers a $20 credit for people who switch to IBank from Quicken -- making the program cost $39.95 instead of $59.95!  What is not to like about that?

I have used IBank's customer service  two different times and found them to be knowledgeable, efficient, and very helpful.  They answered both questions in my first contact.

Quicken is coming out with a Mac Financial software in February- finally.  It appears to be sort of a Quicken for Mac 2010.  I will not buy it or try it!!

Why?

I resent Intuit's attitude that Mac owners don't deserve an up-to-date program for 3 years.  I don't want to support that kind of treatment to a long-time customer.  Also Intuit's new program seems to be a limited version of their Quicken for Windows programs.  I strongly suggest you check out Inuit's Q & A about the February 2010 Mac program at quicken.com.  I doubt you will want a ""fluff"" but little ""meat"" Quicken on your Mac.

IBank has had 2 updates (free to version 3 owners) within my 8 months of owning the program.  Each update came with a new complete program download and all information from my previous IBank version was transferred with no problems.

The IBank program does not allow ""direct bill pay"" like the old Quicken I was accustomed to.  However -- many banks no longer allow that service any longer either.  Both of my checking account banks (Citizens and TD Bank) do not allow direct bill pay through third party financial software any longer so I did not really suffer a loss by switching to IBank.  That may be a ""security"" protection improvement?

IBank imports Quicken data from Windows and Mac with no problems.  Set up is easy for connecting and using most bank web sites.

I used Turbo Tax for Mac (both platforms are on most versions of TTax and TaxCut CDs) last year.  I do not import information from Quicken or IBank into TTax - oI do import the personal information from previous TurboTax for Windows programs.  I cannot say anything about importing data from IBank.

I think IBank does have a lot to offer and unless you have a business or are very wealthy -- IBank should do the job for you WITH all the dependable and helpful MAC features (and connections to ICal) that you expect from your Mac.

There are some very low ratings of IBank listed in these reviews!  I do not understand why.

I know that I have not had any of the problems addressed in the poor reviews.

If you have an Intel Mac or MacBook -- I do not think there will be a problem that IBank's free customer service could not fix.  However, if there is no ""fix"" for a problem you may experience with IBank -- you lose nothing!  Just take advantage of IBank's free trial money back guarantee!!

I do not have any connection with Intuit or IBank.  I spent my time writing this review because I truly think IBank is a GREAT alternative to Quicken for any new Mac owner!!!"
1,The product arrived in 2 days.  Installation went without a hitch using the Windows 7 easy transfer download from Microsoft.  All my settings and info integrated just fine.  A great buying experience.
0.5,"Overall, the program runs fairly cleanly.  I haven't had too many issues with crashes or freezes, though it isn't the most user friendly, either.

It supported most any video type I threw at it from multiple camcorders, phones, etc.  The one place it failed were on some AVIs of 8mm films that were encoded with the Cineform codec.  I used my 14-day 1-use support request only to get a semi-english response that said ""sorry it doesn't work with Cineform"".  Beware that support is iffy with this product.  You only get 14 days from the point of install, and only 1 issue.  After that you have to pay.  I wouldn't pay for the support I received.

Realtime preview is ok, but it wants to render things a bit more than I expected.  Particularly with speeding up video, it has to render the scene completely before it'll show any sort of preview.  Rendering 1080 video from my camcorder took a long time, as does exporting to other formats.

One other annoying thing is that it automatically starts searching and importing media files whenever you start up.  Also, the export presets are plentiful, but you can't modify them.  Instead you have to select a custom format, then set it up to do what you want.  There's also no function to specify a specific output type, then specify a maximum size.  For Amazon reviews, you have a 100MB limit.  I couldn't just set output to 99MB and let it choose the bitrate, nor could I easily exclude audio or set it to mono without making a complete custom setting.  Further, when customizing an output format, it wouldn't update the estimated size, so in the end I just had to make changes and export, then hope it fell under the size I was looking for.

As for actual editing, I thought it did pretty well.  Every program has its own learning curve and this one is no different.  As with most programs it has more transitions and effects than I'll ever use.  I also like that this version comes with the live screen capture built in, as that is something I've used other programs for in the past.

In the future, I'd probably upgrade to the next level up to be able to author blu-ray, but since I don't currently have a BD-writer, it's not an issue for me right now."

0,"This is going to be an unsatisfactory review, because despite repeated attempts and the assistance of tech support, I was not able to get this new version of Microsoft Outlook to work with my business email server. It worked fine with the previous version of Outlook, but this time around it was a no go.

The program itself seemed okay. But one big drawback is that it appears you need to be running Office 2007 in order to get full functionality out of this program. And I don't care for Office 2007. I'm still running Office 2003 because I much prefer that suite of programs.

So mixed results for me. Not all of them are presumably the fault of the product. But ultimately this wasn't an upgrade that it felt it necessary to make."
0,"TurboTax Deluxe Fed, Efile and State 2013 with Refund Bonus Offer  is a good tax program. I do feel it is a overprice and it gets the job done without an accountant. Recommended."
-1,"I have been involved with computers for 22 years. I am no expert in designing or programing of computers, but I have a ton of experience using computers. In today's world, you should not even think about going online without protection from viruses, or being hacked.

I am a long time user of Trend Micro's line of products, and have had nothing but the best results using their virus protection, and firewall to protect me from all threats while being online.

When Trend Micro brought out this newest version of their program, I jumped right on it. I didn't feel a need to research the product, since I trusted the company 100%. As soon as I installed this program, I regretted doing so.

First of all, it has no firewall protection at all. The company says that their program ""enhances"" the firewall available with the Windows operating system, yet refuses to give details of just how it does this. Also, many users are having trouble with lost files, and getting the program to allow known websites to be recognized as friendly.

Basically this program is a dumbed-down version of their software, giving the user less protection, and next to no control of how the program functions.

After I decided I didn't want this junk protecting me, I attempted to roll back to the older version of the program. It was a 3 hour ordeal trying to get the software to uninstall. Windows' uninstall program could not get rid of it. Next, I tried to download an uninstall tool directly from Trend Micro, but that didn't work either. I had to purchase a copy of the older version of the program, right here on Amazon, since Trend Micro didn't offer it on their site. That copy had a ""Forced Uninstall"" tool on the CD, which finally cleaned this newer version off my computer.

Bottom line: Stay away.....very far away, from this program. If you want the best program, from my experience, go with Trend Micro's ""Internet Security Pro"" program. It's from the same company, but is a top notch program. You can get the program right here on Amazon, at a great price."

There is also no ability to reconcile bank accounts online, or with any type of transaction download.  I also can't get Sage Accounting to cooperate with Microsoft Outlook.

0.5,"Office for Mac is a really good software.  In fact, I think this version is better than the MS software that installs on the PC.  The floating palettes, the beautiful interface - is an improvement over the PC version.

The only slight drawbacks are that that the software has to ""render"" excel and word documents into it's own format, which takes a few seconds wait, and that Apple's own software is now becoming more compatible with MS Office files, therefore reducing the need for this software.

However, I really believe you can justify going out and paying the price for this software, it's really great.  MS Office is still the standard for business-oriented document interchange.  If your new to MAC and used to PC's and MS Office, then this helps in the transition."
-1,"My gripe relates exclusively to the activation scheme, which includes surreptitious installation of a rogue program called C-Dilla on your hard drive.
I've been using TT for roughly ten years.  The program itself is great, but I'm strongly opposed to the aggravation of the various activation processes used by Intuit, Microsoft and others.  I concur with the need for software developers to protect themselves against piracy, but it shouldn't be done at the expense of honest consumers.  So, next year I switch to TaxCut."
0.5,"Every year the software goes up but this year the price incred a lot (which is why I bought a ""new or used"" version from an independent reseller. Turbo tax always seemed more difficukt to use.

It's interesting that while there are competive version of Ssecurity software, TT and TC have been ONLY tax software out there and hence can both raise prices and make the taxpayer pay.

But, other than the pricing and the annoyance with the ""jump to where this number comes from"" function, which gives you a list of choices, I'm happy with this software.

But, as a CPA, I only use it for gathering info and calculating, not for looking for deductions or other tax law changes."
0.5,"Painter 12 on Win 7 64 bit is horribly slow.  I thought something was wrong with my machine so I installed it on a couple more machines(one with a clean Win install) with the same results.  First off the program has got to be one of the slowest to startup software in history.  If you have a lot of fonts on your machine you are going to have to delete a lot of them to get your total fonts below 800.  If you don't then you will have to take a 5 min coffee break after starting the program.  Once you get the program started many of the brushes are sluggish.  To really see what a dog it is run one of the scripts and watch your I7 processor stay at 100% while the fans speed up.  The scripts run much slower on a modern I7 Win 7 machine than on an old 4 year old Mac Pro with 10.6.7.  Compared to Painter 11 on the same Win 7 machine this runs like a dog.

On a Mac 10.6.7 machine things are much better.  Some of the brushes lag much more than they should though.  It is just not as smooth as the Painter 11 it replaces.

It is VERY apparent this program was rushed out the door to meet a schedule rather than it actually being ready.  I have waited a month to post this because I wanted to give Corel some time to release an emergency patch to speed things up but have seen nothing.

Update on SP1:

I have been testing SP1 and things are MUCH improved with better startup times and overall performance.  I think the program now warrants 4 stars and have upped my rating of it."
-0.5,"I have had a couple of different versions of Quicken over my life. My last was version 2012 and I hated it. Every time I would sync my checking account, I had to reconcile since it typically missed pulling in things. When it missed a few, it became cumbersome to even want to use it, so I uninstalled.

Now version 2013.  I was happy that setting up accounts was even easier with this version. I got everything synced and thought it looked good. I synced again after a few days and wouldn't you know it, my checking account (different bank this time) was wrong. It was missing entries. I deleted, set it up again, which does take a while  assigning categories. I did a sync a few days later and this time it was fine.  Great I thought.  I just synced again today and sure enough, it is missing several entries.  One from over a week ago.  If I delete the account and set it up again, those same entries do come over, so it is not like it is a pending transaction.

So, I hate this software. Two different versions, different banks, and it still skips downloading entries.  What good is financial software if it does this?  I want to use it for its most basic functionality and that fails for me miserably.

If Quicken support comments, yes, I have the latest updates. i also had them with 2012 and it did not matter then either."
0,"I have been a diehard Trend customer for a little while, and I have had no issues with their products until this version came out. Oddly, my issues with this version spilled over and fouled up the 2006 version when I rolled back. Not all is bad, but there is not enough good here to keep me in the ranks. I'll talk about the good first, then discuss the bad.

I like the fact that Trend offers 3 installations per license, and this was a strong motivator for my upgrade from the 2006 version. With 2 computers immediately in use and another running a dual-boot config, the license scheme is a good option for me.

Installation is smooth and painless. I never had any issues with installation and I was up and running very quickly - typical of Trend's installation process. Loading software should ALWAYS be simple and straightforward, and Trend has always provided such an experience to me.

Compared to the 2006 version, the interface is visually more appealing. This is largely cosmetic.

Most features of the suite are not appreciably improved, with the notable exception of the antispam component. With the 2007 edition the antispam has taken a large leap forward, in my case achieving a near 100% accuracy rate. This alone gave me serious reason to think long and hard about leaving Trend for another product.

Not everything is good with the 2007 edition, however. On one system, I experienced the massive slowdown about which many have complained (the culprit, by the way, is the antivirus component). On another system, there was no issue. The system with the problem was an AMD64-based system, whereas the other was an Intel P4 system.

I experienced another annoyance with the program which ultimately led me to decide on a new solution. Even though I had purchased a license and was covered for many months, about every 3 days Trend would complain that I was not registered and that I needed to submit my information to ensure that I was legal. Both of my installations were doing this, and when I would enter my email address again I would get an email from Trend that I had assumed the registration from myself and was no longer the registered user.

I downgraded to the 2006 version, with which I had had excellent results, and the registration issue continued on both computers. After fighting with this for several weeks, I uninstalled from both computers and loaded up Panda Internet Security 2007.

After 3-4 years of good packages and reviews, Trend let a lemon out of the lab with their 2007 edition. I cannot recommend it. While it works and it does protect the system, the issues I experienced assured that I would not be a repeat customer again."

0,"Corel's Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus offers an abundance of features.  Learning to use them is a real trial.

I moved from Adobe's Captivate, a program I truly enjoyed using, to VideoStudio 11.5 Plus, because of Adobe's insistence on flash video.  I'm finding that it may be easier and quicker to find a good converter program and convert my videos to flash rather than continue to struggle with VideoStudio.

While feature-rich and compatible with many video formats, the documentation for VideoStudio is poor.  The User's Guide is small and packed with tiny print and graphics.  While I feel sure that everything possible has been included in the Guide, reading such tiny print while trying to follow along online is extremely difficult.  Searching the Corel website for video tutorials produced a few but not enough basic tutorials for the program.

VideoStudio 11.5 Plus is a good program (from what I can tell so far) at a reasonable price, especially when compared to alternatives offered by Adobe and Sony.  It is my hope that Corel will add many online tutorials so that customers will be able to develop their skills to take full advantage of all the features the program offers.

Four stars for the software, one star for documentation, three stars overall."

I like this software very much as an alternative to Camtasia Studio - a much more expensive bit of software by TechSmith.  Corel offers great tutorials, a very good PDF User Manual, Community Forum and a free trial (30 days) for those who want to try it out before they buy.

On my Windows 7 PC it ran flawlessly as it did on my Window 10 PC.  Installation was easy via download and a little bit fussy via the included DVD in the package I received. (I had to go into My Computer to find the file to get it to launch.)

Once installed there are lots of free templates, font packages and background downloads that you can add to your software as desired.

Overall, this product is about as easy to use as its competitors at first glance, but the tutorials and clean interface make it something that is relatively easy to use with practice.  (Try out the FREE trial on the Corel site to give it a go before you buy, and you'll really know if this one is for you.)

0.5,"In addition to writing many reviews on Amazon of entertainment products, I am also a CPA (and have reviewed some business books here). As such I have clients who come to me to prepare their taxes after they have used tax prep software, because the software asks questions in the interviews but sometimes overlooks their personal situation. Software is great for calculating and works well in simple situations. It's also (reasonably inexpensive).

Willmaking software and other legal software is similar. If you want to leave all your estate to one or two places, it's quick and simple. If you want to divide things based on certain ""Circumstances"" it isn't. BUT, if it gets you to at least make a will and - just as important - a Medical power of attorney, then it will serve its purpose. I've used both software (early versions of Will Maker when Nolo Press first started in the 1970s) and an attorney. Both had distinct advantages. I did find that if I spent the time with the software deciding what I thought I wanted in the Will and then gave the printed version to an attorney (knowledgeable in Estates) it cut down the attorney's fee as they didn't have to take the time to talk out my intentions. I had the best of both worlds.

This new version is user friendly and an improvement over past versions. And it is nice to have other legal forms included.

So, in my opinion, I would recommend it as a TOOL, but if you have even a moderately complicated estate, use it for the first pass and then consult an estate attorney.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I installed this program on my laptop running XP Professional.  Their was no problem loading, and no problems setting it up the first time I used it.

But, I have absolutely no use for this program.  McAfee brags that it will work with Norton and many other security programs, and it does work with my Norton 360.  However, Norton 360 includes a similar anti-theft feature using a vault.  It is just one of seventeen features.

Worse, it ignores the possibility of simply saving files you do not want anyone else to see on a memory card. You hide the card when you turn off your computer.  I do this with my Palm PDA files, just sticking the card in a drawer.  I would do this with porn if I had any, only I would hide it better.  HeHe

1,Was good way back then
0,"Or like me they will find themselves tolerating over time by ignoring it's most obnoxious features.

I've been running Windows 8 upgrade for the last couple of days and wanted to give my initial impressions of the latest Microsoft OS, as someone that's been using Windows forever i.e. Win 3.11;it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be and then again not as good as it could be.

First, I ran the compatibility checker of course and it said all hardware was compatible and only had a couple of software problems like it said I had to uninstall security essentials and wireshark not compatible. Not bad I thought. First impressions are important and the Windows 8 upgrade setup program didn't give a good first impression. It's more confusing that the older Win7 installer for experienced user. I couldn't tell if I could install on separate partition since the only options were erase everything or upgrade everything. And a WARNING if you plan on keeping Windows 7 around in case you are not sure if you want to stick with Windows 8 don't run the installer inside Windows because it will automatically upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 8! Later I figured out you can get the more familiar win 7 installer,if you boot directly from the DVD that is, where it lets you choose what partition to install on and let's you erase, create new partitions and do a clean install. Anyways, I did a dual boot install just to play it safe and keep Win7 around if needed. After finishing the install ,which didn't really seem much faster than Win7, and actually I thought it locked up at one point but it was hard to tell with the new plain square logo which doesn't even pulsate anymore like Win7 did when you booted.

After the upgrade completed, I found out that my wireless didn't work. That's right even though it said my wireless was compatible it didn't work and I just got yellow exclamation next to it. I was about to give up but I figured I just try the trick I did when Vista first came out which is use another wireless usb stick to connect to the Internet and see if windows could find any drivers for it and sure enough that worked,so much for an improvement over Win7 in that regard.

The first time you log into Windows 8 it plays a video showing you how to use Windows by moving your mouse to the edges. You know the GUI is unintuitive when they have to show a video just so you can figure out how to use the new OS GUI! If you don't want to waste time fumbling around trying to figure out where everything went and disappeared to learning the Win+X shortcut is essential! Actually, this is the first Windows version where I've actually used the keyboard more than my mouse since some things now take too many steps i.e. like shutting down or are near impossible to do. I got stuck a couple of times in some of the new metro apps took over my entire screen and I wasn't able to quit or get back to the desktop! Tip: if this happens to you just hit the Windows key on your keyboard. If you really can't stand the new GUI you can recreate everything just like in Win7 for the most part and stay in the classic desktop instead of the new metro start screen. I think the two things that are going to annoy most people is the lack of the Start button and inability to boot directly to the old classic desktop instead of Metro. I know it still bugs me!

All the programs and games I normally use in Windows 7 seem to work just fine in Windows 8. If it doesn't you can try right clicking to troubleshoot compatibility. My WEI score is the same in Win8 as it was in Win7 so seems no performance change according to that benchmark. Seems to be way more stable than Vista or even Win7 when it first came out. Gotten a lot fewer crashes than when Win7 first came out. My problematic wireless usb, which I mentioned isn't compatible, even though Windows 8 says it is has been causing the most problems even causing a BSOD!

Another thing I didn't like is that there was like a 200MB update as soon as I first logged in and unlike Win7, Win8 rudely rebooted my computer in the middle of a browsing session and didn't warn me or give me option to postpone the reboot. At least on Mac OS X there is option to restore all your windows and browser to the way you had them, even after a reboot. Some of the things I do like about it so far is that you can now read pdf files without having to install acrobat just like mac os has always been able to, and IE now comes with Flash already built in. It's always annoying having to install all those basic programs.

I really like the new task manager, it gives you a lot more info than before and Microsoft now has something that even mac os does which is very cool and needed by people nowadays with bandwidth caps, metered connections. If your right click your wireless it'll tell you how much bandwidth you have used. Now that I think about it a lot of the new stuff in Win8 seems like it's copied directly from OS X. For example, there are no games included now and Microsoft basically forces you to get minesweeper and solitare from the app store now! The icons on the metro screen are just like a cross between the widgets in OS X dashboard and launchpad. It's looks like they also copied the Xbox GUI and brought it into windows.

Smartscreen, which caught me off guard first time I tried installing something I downloaded from the Internet, is Microsoft's version of Gatekeeper which does the same thing on OS X. It get's very annoying if you don't have an Internet connection because it will appear that the installation program is frozen until it figures out you aren't connected! So that is one of the new security features they added to Win8. Secure boot is another one that is causing uproar in the Linux community since it causes headaches if you want to dual boot Windows and Linux.

Biggest disappointments, from a technical point of view, is that Win8 isn't 64bit only like we thought it would be a couple of years ago. Even Mac OS X is now fully 64-bit although that upset the people that couldn't upgrade their older Macs. Also, the Achilles heel of Windows, the registry, because it's too easy to corrupt and render Windows useless, is still there along with the winsxs problem. The WinSxs problem can grow out of hand and eat up all your disk space! I've been saying since XP ,why can't they include .net into windows instead of making you download it like Java? A couple of programs I tried to run said I needed the .net 2 or 3 mainly Steam games and so I had to download another 20-200MB file for that to work and you have to be connected to net to download it since there is no standalone version.

Another big letdown is that only the server version got the new filesystem ReFS, win8 only got storage spaces, which is more software raid. Microsoft has been promising a new improved filesystem several Windows versions back. I think the hardcore power users are going to have to accept the fact that the future of both Windows and Mac OS X is going to become and more geared to the iPod and Xbox crowd with their simplistic touch GUI and interface. This is also the group I'm guessing will have a more favorable view of the new GUI changes. I guess I'd probably be way more impressed if I had a touch capable PC since a lot of the new stuff seems to be geared towards that? I mean the command line is still there somewhere but it's hidden pretty good just like in OS X. Only thing I've really seen for geeks is something that macs and linux have been able to do for a long time already which is run the operating system from an external or usb stick, called windows to go but you need enterprise version for that.

As far as improvements in performance go, I haven't really seen any performance increases or disc space savings to warrant being in a rush to upgrade. My boot times are pretty much the same as with Win7 but then again I have an SSD drive , so Windows has already been pretty fast using that. In fact, the upgrade installer said I needed to free up at least 20GB of space min to even start the upgrade! Still no less than Win7 and XP only needs 10GB. Personally, I think I'll stick with Win8 it since I need to do a clean install on my SSD anyways since I have a whole bunch of old Windows 7 updates hogging up my SSD (the WinSXS problem I mentioned above) and haven't really had any major show stoppers so far like Vista or even Win7 when it first came out.

Finally, you need to get the media center upgrade, to play DVD's, otherwise you can't even play dvd's without installing powerdvd or some other program! I think this new version of Windows would be a lot more popular if it wasn't for Microsoft arbitrarily removing the start button so users are forced to use the new metro start screen whether you want to or not!

Finally they did add a new option to disk cleanup that few will notice that addresses the WinSXS issue:
This is a MAJOR improvement over Windows 7, but I bet they only did it for Windows 8 because of all the ranting about WinSxS.
This is a fantastic news for SSD users!

You can find Disk Cleanup by typing: WIN Key and start typing Disk Cleanup
Click the Disk Cleanup's ""Clean up System Files"" Button in the middle of the screen.
Check the box for Previous Windows Installation(s)
Click ""OK"" button and click the ""Delete"" Confirmation button.
Now, only if they included a registry cleaner!
and fixed the start button and booting into metro issues this would be a solid OS upgrade!"

1,"Be warned.....buying the Rosetta Stone is not enough to learn spanish. No, in addition to buying the Rosetta Stone you must also be willing to dedicate at least 45-60 minutes a day to learning Spanish. If you are willing to dedicate the time you can be confident that you will see positive results.

  The Rosetta Stone is amazing effective in drilling in lessons with the use of games and patterns while forgoing the old-fashioned method of memorizing lists of words. At first you don't realize that you are learning spanish...and then as the days roll by you gradually realize that you are beginning to understand a variety of words and phrases. It reminds me of putting together a puzzle - it takes a little time before you see the picture coming together.

  The voice recognition software is great for helping you to learn to talk (almost) like a native. While your pronunciation does not need to be perfect to advance it does need to be close. This is a very effective way to help transfer the lessons that you are learning into usable communication skills. In fact, to me this is the primary benefit that the Rosetta Stone has over any other language learning device - it offers immediate feedback!

Things that I enjoy-

  - Intuitive approach to learning - both through word identification and by speaking. The voice identification software will help you take your language learning to the next lesson.
  - More than one user is allowed. The Rosetta Stone is currently tracking of both me and my wife.
  - Comprehensive language suite - once you are finished (and I am not close to being finished) you can be assured that you have gone through a intensive language training course. Simply put - you are getting more than the basics.
  - Money back guarantee - if you don't like the Rosetta Stone you have 6 months to get a FULL refund!
  - To me, this seems like the perfect tool for someone home schooling their children. Many of the lessons would be very age appropriate for someone in school

Negatives to the Rosetta Stone -
  - Well it is not cheap
  - You must ""Want"" to learn the language - not partial efforts will be effective
  - one license means one computer - if you have the need to run the software on an additional computer you will need to buy ANOTHER copy of the software.

  Final verdict - if you are serious about learning spanish The Rosetta Stone will be the perfect investment for you. 5 stars"
0.5,"This is a tough product to review. On one hand, WordPerfect Office offers a powerful and very capable alternative to Microsoft Office. As multiple reviewers have already noted, if you really care about a document's layout the ""Alt + F3"" ""Reveal Codes"" feature is pretty much worth the cost of the purchase.

But the X8 version is not really all that different from the last version I used (X4). And what new features have been added pretty much apply to the Standard or Professional version of WPOX8 and not this one (Home & Student). At this point, I have to add that the ""Home and Student"" edition reviewed here is NOT the same as WPOX8 Academic (more on that in a bit).

So what does one get for $99 (Amazon price at the time of this review)? You get the essentials and they are: the WordPerfect document processor (equivalent to MS Word), Quattro Pro spreadsheet (equivalent to MS Excel), Presentations (equivalent to MS PowerPoint), Lightning (equivalent to MS OneNote), and the AfterShot 2 photo processing app. That's it, but that's probably enough for most folks. (Interestingly, Corel offers a stripped down version of this product -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Office-5-3-Installs/dp/B006N1Q0W2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Office 5 - 3 Installs</a>&nbsp;(essentially, the Corel version of MS Works) - and I can't help but wonder if, at $30, Corel is hurting WPO sales by offering Office (though I suspect Corel hopes Office will be a stepping stone to WPO)).

For me, the sweet spot (as it pertains to features is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-WordPerfect-Office-X8-Standard/dp/B01EB06R10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel WordPerfect Office X8 Standard</a>. But for some reason Corel puts it out of reach by pricing it at $250. I guess there must be some logic, but I'm not following. If you can qualify for the Academic Edition that's the way to go. For $80 you get WPOX8 Professional (which adds the Paradox database application) for less than this Home & Student Edition. Disappointingly, the Perfect Authority ""table of authorities"" feature is an add-on (at $199) for the Standard and Professional versions; perhaps even more disappointingly, Perfect Authority won't work with this (Home & Student) edition.

If Corel really wants to keep a foothold with the ""next gen"" of users it HAS to update the interface; the software still looks like it did a decade (or more) ago. Frankly, this looked good when WFWG 3.11 was the current OS (and that was 1993)! What with folks moving away from WPO years ago and now folks moving away from the desktop/laptop entirely, Corel has got to do something to refresh the look. Even the free, Open Source LibreOffice has updated its look. It amazes me is that it's the cheaper, less capable product - Corel Office - that uses a MS Word ribbon interface that is far more modern and user-friendly (to the eyes) than WPOX8. So if Corel believes WPO can survive because lawyers still like the pleading and authorities features, okay. But I think it is ultimately a losing strategy.

WordPerfect, despite its looks, is - I believe - a superior product to MS Word (if it matters to you what your document looks like behind the scenes). I have used both since the late 1980s and know that you can do more with the former than latter. Quattro Pro is equally as capable as Excel at most basic tasks, but the world is Excel-based (so most work in QP will have to be ""translated"" for use in Excel). Finally, I think Presentations is a better presenting app than PowerPoint, but once again, the world is PowerPoint-centric. Of the three, the least difficult to transition output over to an MS Office-centric world is WordPerfect (which is fortunate as WP is the reason I think most people buy this suite). Even if this is the case, don't discount the other two: I learned spreadsheets on QP and found it a bit easier to understand the concept of spreadsheets on QP than I did on Excel; same with Presentations (easier to use initially; which is kind of a hoot considering WP's long-standing reputation of having a steep learning curve!).

After Shot 2 is a full version photo editing/adjusting application. I don't do a whole lot of work with photos so my impressions are those of an amateur. But from all appearances it appears to be a comprehensive, full-featured app. It is, however, 1 version behind; the most current version is 3.x (which you will learn about when closing version 2 and being shown an offer to upgrade to version 3 for $49.

One last thought. Usually ""user help"" is an after-thought; the mind set these days seems to be that if you can't figure it out, do an internet search or buy an after-market book. It's pleasing to see Corel not going that route; the Corel Reference Center utility is superb.

Summary: 4 stars. Functional, powerful, capable, at $99 you get a great program at a reasonable price and one that doesn't require an email account to activate and keep active. A 5-star bit of software. But it looks so, so, so old; WPO is in drastic need of a facelift. And the features added to make WPOX8 better than previous offerings is slim. The old look and minimal reasons to upgrade earn -1 star. So while I really want to support Corel's latest edition of WPO, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that I think the optimal way to go (if you can't get the Academic version) is either to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WordPerfect-Office-X7-Standard/dp/B00JC5Y6WM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WordPerfect Office X7 Standard</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Wordperfect-Office-X7-Home-Student-Product-Key-Card/dp/B00YYCI98K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Wordperfect Office X7 Home & Student - Product Key Card</a>. At $140 you get a more powerful suite in WPOX7 Standard than WPOX8 H&S and don't really miss anything for $40 more than WPOX8 H&S. If one decides to go the H&S route, WPOX7 Home & Student comes in at $40 and is essentially identical to WPOX8 H&S (but less than half the cost). Like I said, not sure I'm following Corel's pricing strategies; to me, Corel has to do something if it wants WPO to remain a viable product. Anyway, take a look at the attached comparisons downloaded from Corel's WP web page...(couldn't post .pdf files so screenshots will have to suffice; I also posted a screenshot of this review in progress so you can get a glimpse of the interface)."
1,"Did my homework on these network-through-your-household-wiring things, and was skeptical.  Found reviews of the Corinex HomeNet Powerline HD200 adapters, found lots of either one-star or five-star ratings, and lots of sob stories about how poor the installation instructions were, and what a terrible ordeal it was to get them installed and working properly.  I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.

I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.  I can now stream Netflix movies on my PS3 in an area of our house that has been a dead zone for the signal from our wireless router.  I had resigned myself to spending hours screwing around with these things, and now I can watch movies instead!  Couldn't be happier with this product."
1,"I have been using Office products for a long, long time.  My previous (home) install was Office 2007 and I will be honest, I was pretty happy with it.  I use 2010 at work and there was no real difference between the two, but recently our work upgraded to Office 365.  I have to say that the newer Office suite of products is much better.  While it takes a bit of time to get used to the format & style changes, once you get acquainted it is more intuitive and faster.  All the familiar functionality is there with some nice new additions.  But the over all advantage is the interface enhancements.

Office 2016 is the same basic suite as 365.

Regarding the install - here is what you get.

Open the package and you get a box about the size of a pack of playing cards.  Inside is a link to an download site and a user key (good for 5 PC's).  That is it, nothing else.  In fact the user key is printed on a business card sized piece of paper and the rest is in a small booklet.  They could have saved a lot of space by just placing all of the info on the card and be done with it.  After all - it is really pretty simple.  In fact - all of the pertinent info is on the web site that you are directed to and the account code is all you are really buying.

Welcome to 2015.

Select the platform you have, click the button, agree to a few terms and wait a few minutes for the install program to finish downloading.  Double click on it, agree to a few more T's & C's and let it run.  After that you are good to go.  Simple as that.

I can not comment on why others had issues, but it ran as clean as I described on three separate PC's so far and I have had no problems."
0,"With Adobe Reader being free and regularly updated, and Microsoft Office having a built-in PDF creator in it's popular apps, it would seem that someone who spends over fifty dollars for this product would have some very specialized needs that the average home or business doesn't have.

The most useful feature would appear to be having the ability to open PDF documents (like forms) and edit them.  That alone would make it useful to me, however the first two forms I tried to ""fill in the blanks"" could not be edited by PDF Fusion. It seems it is common for companies who create forms to lock them so their customers can't make changes to the content of the form.  Asking people who regularly create PDF forms at one particular business I was informed that locking their documents is something they do routinely.  Hence, what could be a useful feature of PDF Fusion may not be that useful after all.

As far as Corel's claim to be able to open ""100 different file formats"", frankly there is no format I've encountered that can't be opened with software that's already on my computer.  Another advertised feature is the ability to convert PDF documents to such formats as MS Word, but don't expect the final document to be identical to the original.  PDF Fusion has some difficulty converting a fairly large share of what is on the original to a usable Word document.

It also runs much slower when opening a PDF than Adobe Reader.

I don't recall having the need very often to assemble numerous files into one document, but recognize that need may exist in some situations.  For those who need it, that may be an attractive feature.

The #1 negative is that Corel installs a prompt that will never let you open Word, Excel or PowerPoint again without insisting that you let PDF Fusion install a sub-app into your Office Suite.  They don't give you the option to say ""no and don't ask me again"" and they don't tell you what that sub-app is or what it will do to the PDF feature already built in to Office.  If you do end up buying PDF Fusion, and like your Office Suite just the way it already is, you can go to the ""uninstall a program"" feature in your Control Panel and uninstall that function separately. Unfortunately Corel doesn't tell you where or how to do it.

This review won't include a Pros/Cons section as the Amazon page does a good job listing the features. PDF Fusion is definitely a product that you should read all the reviews (positive and negative) and download a trial version before you buy it.  I've reset my PDF's back to Adobe Reader as the default and will leave PDF Fusion installed, but as far as overall functionality it can only be rated as ""okay""."
1,"I got away from TurboTax for the last couple of years and really paid for it in frustration.
I just finished my taxes with TurboTax and it took a fraction of the time it did with Block, and I am not shaking and about to blow a gasket.
Spend the extra $10.00."
1,This product is an excellent - low cost for great product.  We have used it many times on numerous jobs & recommend it highly.
1,It does everything Turbo Tax 2013 did and seemed easier to navigate. Best of all I got to tell turbo tax they got greedy when trying to push their customers into a higher priced version and I would no longer be using their products.
0.5,"Although I've been using Quicken to track my expenses going back over 25 years, I never got around to installing the last several versions before this one. So I have to compare how much of an improvement there has been compared to the years before that. New versions (actually new releases, using the industry parlance that was in place when Quicken for DOS first hit the market) are iterative, add some new features, but are largely the same as older versions with only one or two significantly new or improved features. If you put this in a historical context, that's actually a good thing. When Scott Cook first came up with Quicken, he didn't take the traditional approach. He advertised in airline magazines rather than computer magazines and advertised to ""regular people"" rather than computer people. Instead of selling for the inflation-adjusted price of $854, which was common for spreadsheets, databases and word processors of the day, he sold the software for well under $100, inflation adjusted. And he sold annual updates for a price low enough that it was literally cheaper than buying an aftermarket book on how to use the product. They weren't major changes, but they were affordable. So when you pay a mere $39.99 for the entire product, you are benefiting from a revolution that Scott Cook single-handedly put in place to change the entire software industry.

In that sense, you get a lot for your money. When I first started using Quicken, it was an easy way to keep my checkbook balanced, and allowed me to print checks directly from a dot matrix printer. Over time, support was added for credit cards, investments, real property, and even business functions depending on the version. The software lets you look at the big picture when it comes to your finances. It lets you link accounts in such a way that you can see what comes out of one account when it goes into another account, or what goes from your cash account to your investment account or from your checking account to pay your credit card bills. It lets you keep track of your receipts and keep images of your checks or invoices with the individual transactions. And it keeps track of your securities, monitors the prices, and shows you how well your investments perform. It does so a lot better than tools you might find at your brokerage since there are so many ways of reporting things.

The latest version has cloud support and support for an app for your phone. Yes, it's limited to spending accounts and you will still have to use an app from your broker to get an instant view of your investments. Then again, you would need to do so to execute trades anyway. But for spending, it's a lot easier to snap a photo of a receipt with a smartphone than to scan it or enter it later, so when it syncs with the desktop app, it's easier to match things up with downloaded transactions.

It's come a long way from its origins, and although I no longer need it for printing out the checks to pay my monthly bills, I can use it to track more complex financial concerns such as stocks, bonds, options trading, ESPP shares, employee stock options, the value of my home, my mortgage payments with an ongoing view of principal and interest, and even paychecks with the amount split to account for federal, state, and local taxes, FICA, medicare and deductions for 401(k)s (which end up in the appropriate account register automatically) or healthcare spending or ESPPs. It lets you keep track of spending by categories, and allows for tags (formerly classes) so you can track things in multiple directions. If you want to get a report on spending by category or figure out how much you spent on education or dining, it's easy. And if you tag things so that you know which expenses were for your 2006 Hawaii trip, you can know how much you spent in total or break it down by airfare, lodging, meals or souvenirs. You can even use foreign currency and account for exchange rates.  You can use as little or as many of these features as you want. You can establish budgets and see how well you've been doing for years or decades, depending on how long you've been using the product.

The product isn't perfect and still has a few bugs in it that affect usability but not the underlying financial integrity of your data. And some tasks are easier than others. Some of the wizards work from some places and not others. And some areas are not optimized for the type of security. For example, options trading is a thinly disguised version of stock trading, won't let you use standard actions such as ""sell to open"", ""buy to close"" or expire contracts based on the date in the symbol and the price of the underlying security. You might need to use less obvious terms such as buying to cover at zero cost in order to close out expired contracts. And you need to view things as shares instead of contracts. Plus there's no price history for options. And there's no support for RSUs, despite the fact that the people in charge of Quicken have been granted RSUs, and thus can't use the product to track their own finances in a comprehensive way.

Despite the limitations, the product still covers the most common needs of most users. I'd like to see more emphasis on adding support for new features such as the ones I've mentioned, especially given that they aren't major programming tasks. I think the product has gotten so comprehensive that they are running out of ideas as to what to add for new releases.

The product also comes with three years of data service at no extra charge, after which you will most likely want to get a newer version. I think they would have had fewer detractors had they marketed the data service as a separate entity and let you know they are bundling it for free. The product itself does not expire, as many people think, but becomes a lot less useful once the data service expires and you can no longer download from your financial institutions. It's simply too expensive for the company to offer that kind of support for a longer period than what they cover, and it's cheap enough that even if you don't upgrade annually, it's worth getting a new version at least every two years.

Four stars represents my overall satisfaction with respect to meeting my particular financial needs, but I'd give it five stars for value."
1,"Smallest 4 port hub that I could find.  I use it to recharge power on my road warrier devices (cell phone, mp3 player, camera, etc) from my laptop... using USB cables/plugs from boxwave."
-1,"I was excited with the Black Friday sale price of $29.95, but this is no bargain if you want to include graphics/pictures in your PDF files.  Corel PDF Fusion uses very heavy compression with no user control over the image quality.  This is particularly obvious if you have an image that includes high contrast text, such as black text on white background.  You will get lots of compression artifacts and the text will be color tinges along the edges.  I use Adobe Pro at work and was not expecting this product to compare to that, but I thought I could at least include pictures in my created PDF without the image quality being reduced so greatly.
Don't every try to fill in a PDF blank form with this product because it IS NOT WYSIWYG.  Forms that appear fine on the screen will print with text fields chopped of or print as blank fields.  Attempting to edit the text field to reposition it on the form is like working in the dark.  You have no clue if your positioning/sizing has been done correctly until you print it again.  Maybe the worst piece of commercial software I have used in over 40 years in the business."

0.5,"I am not a native speaker of Spanish.  So, I ordered this and I've ""played"" with it.  Once I was able to figure it out, I found it to be very simple and easy to use.  It covers a lot of words and grammar and it offers a way of learning a lot of the basics, that, for me, is very easy.  It's simple to just click it on, play with the software for 20"" a day ... I need a lot more review than many folks, so repetition has been necessary for me.  I like it, there are other Spanish language packages, I don't know how this compares to the others.  I'd give it a ""B+"" and recommend it to others."
0.5,"Microsoft did a good job with this version, as it really offers some improved enhancements and features, such as:

- Starts up quicker, averaging around 10 seconds.  The previous version used to take about 30 seconds before it was ready for use.
- Uses a navigational ribbon that's makes finding key program functionality a real snap.  (Reduces the need to ""menu dive"" in order to find the key feature you're looking for.)
- Improves program stability!  One of the frustrations from the previous version is that you'd be working with a PowerPoint presentation and suddenly, ""POOF"" and the program crashed for no real reason.  This version seems to be well designed and have had very few crashes, which is a welcome improvement!
- Improves compatibility between the PC and Mac document versions.  In the past, I've had some ""weird"" things happen, such as ""magically"" missing pages, or document elements completely disappear without reason, etc.
- Most of the features are still very much ""traditional"" for Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel and Entourage.  If you know the PC version, you'll find it a snap to use the Mac edition too!

Disadvantages:

- Microsoft Access and Publisher are not available for the Mac, so you're limited as to what you can accomplish with the Mac edition.
- Lack of Macros is a serious problem if you need to use customized Excel worksheets.
- Microsoft seems to think that Mac people are ""graphics-only"" users, so they don't provide the key business features that most would expect with an office productivity suite.
- Seems like Microsoft focused upon making the program ""pretty"" and not so much ""functional"" at times.  It would be best to have both, if possible.
- Having to use a pop-up menu that covers a part of the screen in order to do common word processing features, such as bold, italics, underline, text alignment, etc. can get frustrating."

0.5,"I've used Corel's PaintShop software since the X4 edition.  Corel keeps tweaking the software to improve it.

This latest iteration offers a pure 64-bit version.  The features of the 64-bit version are generally the same as those of the 32-bit version.  However, it makes much more effective use of extended memory.  I ran this on a machine with an Intel Ivy Bridge i7 processor and 16 gb of DDR3-1866 memory, and it runs like butter even on the largest RAW image files.  The software seems stable -- I didn't experience any odd bugs or crashes.

I've used Adobe products and have PhotoShop CS5.  This software can do just about anything the Adobe program can do, and it does it for a fraction of the price.  That said, Adobe is more of an industry standard, so you're more likely to find people using that solution.

In all, this is powerful photo editing software at a reasonable price.  As with any powerful software, there is a learning curve.  But there are aftermarket books that will help you with that if you're interested.

I dock it one star because Corel has a bad habit of intrusive marketing, with various ads popping up from time to time when you load the program.  I could live without that aggressive marketing, which seems amateurish and, frankly, a bit desperate."
1,"I purchased this full version so I could load it on my Macbook via bootcamp and it worked flawlessly. All of the drivers for my computer peripherals were loaded correctly. The At&T Uverse wireless internet was configured in a snap. Bootcamp is a great utility. I was only able to load 32 bit version because my mac was just on the outside of the requirements for 64 bit. But it still works great!  I really like this version of windows. We use XP at work and it was great for a while especially after win 95 but Win 7 is incredible. We skipped Vista so this upgrade was long overdue. Everything seems to work better. The Adobe CS 5 suite is amazing on Win 7. I wish there were better font management options. All in good time I assume.

Every camera I own that records video does it in a different format, and Pro 6 recognizes every single format.  This is just one aspect of its true versatility.  It doesn't matter if I want to edit video from a webcam, DLSR or digital camera, or a videocamera.  As long as the files are on my computer, and I can find them (heh heh), it can edit them.

The project manager has a browse button.  Just choose the files you want to edit and off you go.  Improve the video and sound quality with the installed correction tools, add titles and transitions easily.  They're in the software package, or you can make your own.  I've done it.  It works!  You can use what's in the package, or add your unique titles and transitions.  You can also add voice-overs and music tracks.

You can save your videos to disk, or share them on youtube.  There's a button for that.

All of this works fast, and if you don't like what you did, you can change it.  As a hobbyist, I spend more time doing this than anything else.

The one thing I wish Corel would do is offer a buying option that allows you to purchase a hard copy of the user manual for a nominal fee.  I know, a lot of people aren't going to read a manual, but when I'm on the computer and need to look up how to do something, it's easier for me to have a book.  There is an online guide you can download, but I want the book.

CorelDraw is quite expansive and a lot to learn, especially when you're on your own. Thankfully, there's tutorials offered by Corel and plenty on Youtube. Corel's included guidebook is a gem! It goes over the different tools you can use. While the hardback book add heft to the package, it is worth it's weight with the information it carries.

  Now this Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X3 takes the place of both of them. All the basic editing functions are pretty much intuitive and easy to find and use. It will switch from photo archive to basic editing to advanced editing and back to archive very easily. It comes with a book showing how to use it and there are online tutorials for its use too. I haven't got very far into its more advanced uses yet but I think this will be the last photo program I'll need for a long time.
  There is just one thing that I did not like about it and the installation of it. And that is it doesn't give you any choice, it takes over, on its own, and it goes through the entire hard drive collecting ever image file on it and puts them all in its photo archive. I would much rather be able to have the CHOICE of which photos and folders to put in its archive. But then that's something that just about every photo program I've ever tried does when its first installed.
  So if you want something more than just the Microsoft Digital Image Pro 10, or something to go with it, I suggest trying this one."
-1,"This is my revised review of Norton 360 version 2.0.  I previously had given a positive review and my review was rated as ""The most helpful favorable review"".  However, after extended use of the product I have to remove my first review and mark this product as DEFECTIVE.  I believe that if the professional review sites that have given this product positive reviews were to run extended trials and followed a policy of revising their initial ratings that they also would drop their ratings after they find that the product starts failing after extended use.

I installed the Norton 360 version 2.0 trial edition downloaded from Norton's website and ran it for 13 days on my Windows Vista SP1 PC before activating it. During that time my system did not have any noticeable computer slowdowns and it ran in the background without any need for intervention.  It also ran just fine for another 7 days after purchasing a license and activating it.

Sounds great, right?  Well, in my second week of owning it, Norton 360 v2 suddenly started having ""Service Framework"" failures and told me I should reboot my PC to ensure stable operation.  I found that I better heed the warning and reboot, because my Quad core PC with 3 GB of RAM would turn into a brick that barely functioned. This is really, really annoying when you are in the middle of doing something and suddenly you have to interrupt your work to reboot the computer... oh and saving your work takes about 10 times as long since the computer suddenly doesn't want to function.

I went through tech support and they had me try a lot of different fixes, including doing a complete uninstall and reinstall of the product. Doing a reinstall actually seemed to make things better for a few days and then suddenly Norton 360 decided it was time to start failing at random intervals again.  I looked on message boards and found that some people claimed that there might be a corrupt file on your system that Norton was scanning and failing on.  The problem with that claim is that is 1) Reinstalling the product and doing a ""comprehensive"" scan didn't cause a failure so I don't think that is really the root cause and 2) even if that was the root cause, if a security product like Norton is going to crash when it finds a corrupt file, then exactly what value does the product provide?  Do you really want to go on a witch hunt for corrupt files on your computer every few days when Norton starts failing on you?

BOTTOM LINE: I wish I could recommend the product, but I CANNOT RECOMMEND.  It simply is DEFECTIVE.  When it works, it works great, but it is NOT STABLE and I believe that any installation of it WILL EVENTUALLY START CRASHING EVEN IF IT SEEMS TO WORK AT FIRST.

If you decide to buy anyway, here are a few notes:

- By default eavesdropping protection is turned off. You can enable it via the settings page. I saw in a professional review that they really recommended turning this feature on.

- You need to ensure that any other virus or firewall programs that you have installed are fully uninstalled before installing this product. Having multiple competing products installed can really mess up your system. I used the Norton removal tool from their web site to fully remove the trial version of Norton Internet Security that I was using prior to installing this software.

- If you are uncertain about this product, download the free trial from symantec first, but note that my problems with the product didn't show up until about day 20 of having it installed.

- If you choose to download the full version of the software from symantec, they place a copy of the full version under C:\ProgramData\Symantec Temporary Files on Windows Vista. Just grab a copy of the software and back it up. This way you don't have to pay to have an ""extended download period"". Or just keep a copy of the trial version around since it allows you to activate it using the product key that the symantec store gives you.

- If you are deciding between purchasing the shipped package from Amazon or Symantec, I would choose Amazon in a heart beat. Amazon customer service rocks. You also could probably download the trial version from symantec, buy the package from Amazon, and then just enter the product code from the Amazon package in the trial software once the Amazon package arrives."

0.5,"It's simple: If you have a newer Mac, you need to get Leopard. It's the best OS X yet, and it's why you own a Mac. Blows away Vista in terms of features and usability, and it's a great first OS for people new to computers. It can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. It's very intuitive, and has a lot of features that are just ""Duh! Why didn't anybody else think of that?"" in their brilliance.

If you're a PC/Windows person thinking of switching, now's the time. Leopard includes Bootcamp, so you can still use full-featured Windows XP or Vista if you want, but I think once you see how nice it can be to use a computer with Leopard, you'll wonder why you ever liked Windows.

Sorry to be ""smug"" (as anti-Mac people might say), but I'm happy with the fact that I switched from building and doing tech support for Windows PCs to the Mac platform. It's just better. It works.

If you're a gamer, you might want to try using this to load Windows Vista Ultimate on a Mac Pro or newer iMac... But if you're just a person who wants to do your work on a computer without worrying all the time, then Leopard on the Mac is the way to go. All your Windows apps, all the great Mac apps and bonuses, and all in a package that costs less than any decent version of Vista."
0.5,"With the advent of various tax softwares, it no longer makes sense to do taxes on paper. Even if you plan to file taxes by mail (not electronically), using a tax software such as Turbo Tax will minimize data entry and hassel of tax research. The only exception might be if you are a 1040EZ filer.

What separates Turbo Tax from its competitors is their attention to detail. They have made the user interface little more intuitive and went to great lengths to provide a user friendly GUI and pictures. Furthermore, they have made great strides in reducing data entry. For example, I was able to simply download the 1099-D (interest income) from my brokerage online and simply upload into Turbo Tax using a intuitive step-through. This saved me a LOT of time doing my taxes. You can also do this for your home mortgage interest payments etc.

At the end of the session, Turbo Tax gives a very intuitive graph of your audit risk and how your tax payments compare against rest of the population."
0.5,"This is my eigth year using Quicken TurboTax and it will be my sixth year using the state tax version. I can't imagine going back to pen and paper to do taxes.

There is a new format this year and I'm not quite sure I like it.  It could be that I'm use to the old format.  However, the program still takes you step-by-step through the tax process by asking you questions about the various sections of the forms. It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.

I tried Taxcut in the past because of the product activation on TurboTax. I had problems with it right off. It stated on the box that you could import TurboTax files but when I tried it wouldn't let me. The Taxcut web site suggested that this was a common problem and that you had to edit your TurboTax file (with TurboTax) to bring it down to a certain size. Still, it didn't tell you what that size was ok or really give you any idea on what to cut out. (I thought all of the our tax info was important).

I have to agree that the advertising included in the product (for more Intuit products) now borders on the ridiculous and the program (like all programs) needs more space and more resources each year but I still think that is better that the competition.

My advice: TurboTax is still the best tax prep software. Don't do your taxes without it."
1,"I have used every Windows version since Windows v1. This is the best version, yet. I got the Professional version of XP because I wanted Remote Desktop, more access-rights configurability and NTFS (you can manually do it on Home). I have been very pleased with this. It is much more stable than 98SE, 98 or 95. It is more stable than my 2000 as well. It actually is considered a 2000 upgrate -- from 5.0 to 5.1 -- but the feature changes are more dramatic and should warrant a 5.5 or 6.0. It is finally multi-user (not multi-account like 2000), so all users can stay logged on with applications running. That being said, to use that functionality, you definitely want to heed the ""minimum requirements""."

The other features--including word processor, spreadsheet, slideshow creator, video, etc. are the same and the design is similar to microsoft office. It works with over sixty types of files, and most notably pdf documents can be both created and edited.

I think the standard edition is worth it because of its unique features. Unfortunately though this program can only be installed on one computer."

That being said, if you can use Photoshop, you can use this.  This version is a nice upgrade from the previous version and the interface will be very friendly to photoshop users.  The uses of this product are virtually unlimited if you are an artist, or if you just like messing around drawing.  My favorite new feature is the Symmetric Drawing Brush, which takes the tedium out of symmetric drawing by doing it for you! It will save you an incredible amount of time and the results are fabulous. Overall, this is a great piece of software and I highly recommend it."
1,"The Norton computer security products consistently receive top reviews from computer publications and web sites.  I've been using Symantec's Norton products for several years with few problems, especially over the last couple of years.  There are always complaints that Norton slows down your computer some, particularly at boot-up, but remember it's busy keeping your machine safe.  Norton has addressed this problem with each release and Norton is much better than it used to be.
If you don't use some sort of computer security and anti-virus product on your computer, your machine will gradually succumb to all the junk out there and you'll have to pay more than the cost for this product to have someone clean it up."

No run time errors like 98SE, no crashes and reboots.  I find it a very easy to use, very stable system.  I also like many of the features, such as the error log.  Instead of listing errors that mean nothing to you, when you right click on the event you get an explanation of what that error means, what caused it and a hyperlink to link to click for further informations and solutions.
I highly recommend this to anyone tired of the constant errors and crashes if other windows versions."

-1,"I believed the hype from Microsoft that Windows 7 was 'better' or 'fixed', 'more stable' ... whatever, so I bought it. First it is sooooo different from XP that it is difficult to navigate. I had to search the internet for instructions to do the simplest of tasks.

I've been running 7 for about 3 or 4 months. I get a blue screen of death about every week or two. The most recent example was yesterday morning. I started to upload a youtube video, went away to have breakfast and came back to a blue screen of death. It's not like I was doing anything complicated, just one IE window open and one upload happening. I'm so disappointed.

Speaking of Internet Explorer, it crashes more than in XP. It just stops working, dims, shows that it's thinking and won't let you do anything for minutes. A company that can not even get a web browser to work right has no business selling an operating system. It's time to upgrade to Firefox.

XP is pretty good. I use that at work everyday. I bought a laptop with Vista. That sucked soooooo bad that I ditched Vista completely and installed Ubuntu. I've had no problems with Ubuntu. I'm going to upgrade to Ubuntu on my desktop(the one with Windows 7 on it now). I will also never be purchasing another Microsoft product, hardware or software. I can't financially support a company that charges for such crappy products.

Ubuntu and Firefox are where it's at."
0.5,"I have had some bad experiences with McAfee products in the past and I started examining McAfee VirusScan Plus 2008 (I'll just call it VSP hereafter) with a skeptical eye. Reading the reviews of others made me uncomfortable with running this application on my system. Furthermore, I have been using another Internet security suite for quite a while now and I was loathe to uninstall it just to load up something by McAfee. I bit the bullet, however, and I can say that I have been pleasantly surprised.

Not everyone has had good fortune with this product - in fact quite a few people have horror stories to share. My experience is mostly positive and as such I have a positive spin to add to the mix.

I had absolutely no difficulty installing VSP. Installation was smooth, painless and relatively quick. Having never loaded up anything by Symantec on my computer, I did not encounter the problem of McAfee refusing to install because of remnants of Norton AV being left behind. After installing, VSP asked for the expected reboot and my system came up without too much difficulty.

My first real issue arrived after that initial reboot. Connecting to the internet, VSP immediately decided it was time to update everything. If I had a high-speed connection I wouldn't care too much, but a 50+ MB download via dial-up took a long time. In fact, it took over 2 hours. The updates are daily, and the main update - AV definitions - is also a sizable download. I can say with absolute conviction that this is NOT a good product for dial-up users.

Once all of the updates were installed, the computer rebooted and I did observe that Windows XP did come up noticeably slower, though not enough to seriously impact anything. The difference was perhaps an extra minute in boot time, which in the grand scheme of things is acceptable though some may get impatient.

I can't complain too much about the antivirus portion of VSP. Though it eats some processing cycles and runs quite slowly, it does not bring the computer to its knees and as a result I can do other things while the scan runs in the background with a minimum of impact. If you tend to run scans in the background, this is by far the most cooperative AV I have used for that specific purpose (and I have used quite a few different ones).

The SiteAdvisor is an interesting animal, and I can say I get varied results. It does not seem to impact surfing speed in my case, but it has a drastic impact on FireFox startup. Once loaded, though, the SiteAdvisor changes color when I hit a potentially dangerous site but stays green for most websites. When searching, however, it updates the links to show the perceived danger level for each site in the list. When on a site that is perceived to be a source of dangerous material, SiteAdvisor provides a detailed analysis of the site with a list of potential danger spots.

The firewall's default settings are weak and permissive, but this is something that can be remedied with a few mouse clicks... After setting the level to ""Stealth"" - one level above total lockdown - I went in search of firewall tests. Every test I tried showed that the firewall protected the system admirably and really hid my computer while connected to the net.

The firewall works like most others on the market. It allows you to block ports, lock down applications, and other related activities. Overall, working with this firewall is unremarkable in that it is similar to others on the market in terms of features and configuration.

I admittedly have not used the email protection features of VSP. I have a low-bandwidth email address so I do not get too many emails that contain malware. Until someone finds me and sends me something, I cannot test this easily.

A disappointment I encountered occurred with the SecurityCenter. Listed on the basic menu is Parental Controls, something I value as I have computer-savvy kids that have been taking more interest in the net. When I went to explore this feature, I found out that it is not installed and that I have to upgrade to a different application suite to get it. In my opinion this should not even be listed on the menu if it is not even available with this edition. The same holds true with the antispam component - it's not available in this edition so it should not even be mentioned in the menus.

VSP has never crashed my computer, and it hasn't broken any applications. It has not broken my connectivity and my printer still works.

I loaded up McAfee VirusScan Plus, fully expecting to add to the horror stories about it. Instead, it surprised me with a pleasant and stable experience. Because of the long update times due to being a dial-up user I will go back to my other solution, but given a broadband connection I would seriously consider leaving it on my system. It appears that maybe McAfee has learned from past mistakes and has put out a workable solution - at least from my perspective. Based on my own experience I can say this is a decent product."

1,"I've used CorelDRAW for years - since CorelDraw 3 - so I was very excited to get the chance to use Corel VideoStudio Ultimate x7.

I'm a complete novice at video editing. Prior to getting VideoStudio, my video was whatever I recorded at the time. I had no idea how to edit out unintended stuff or add titles or add music, etc. Even though it has plenty of very sophisticated and complex editing options available to the user, this software makes it easy to get started.

In the box is two discs. That's it. The user's manual is included in the installation and there are loads of video tutorials you can access from inside program.

Installation was easy and straightforward. Note: the EULA states that you are licensed to have VideoStudio installed on only one computer at a time so if you have multiple computers in your home, choose wisely or you will have to uninstall from one computer in order to install it on another one.

The software places 3 icons on your desktop - VideoStudio, FastFlick and ScreenCap. If you are new to video editing, FastFlick is an amazing tool. Download your videos and pictures that you wish to edit to your computer and then FastFlick will let even a novice produce a surprisingly professional bit of video. Through the use of templates you can add titles, music, add additional video clips, apply effects like pan and zoom and lots of other things. Even if, like me, you've never edited video before, you can use FastFlick.

Corel also makes it easy for you to upload your finished videos to places like YouTube and Facebook, as well as burning your video to a DVD- all from within the software!

VideoStudio is a full-fledged video editing program that gives you a myriad of different ways to edit your raw video. If you've never used video editing software before, there will be a learning curve when it comes to VideoStudio. Don't expect to be able to edit a video immediately. Corel knows this, which is why they created and included FastFlick. It acts as kind of an intro to video editing and at the same time, give you immediate gratification by helping you produce a very attractively edited video right out of the box.

The user's guide, which you can find under the Help tab in VideoStudio, is refreshingly well written and easy to search. It's in .PDF format and you can download it to your computer. It's worth reading even if you aren't normally the type to read the manual. ;-)

For the current price of under $80, I think this software is a bargain! It's easy enough, thanks to FastFlick, that even a newbie can create a respectable video, but powerful enough that someone familiar with this kind of software will be very pleased. (I confirmed this with a friend, whose job it is to edit advertising video. He couldn't believe how powerful it was - even compared to the commercial editing software he uses at work.)

If you want or need to edit your videos to make them something special, Corel made this software for you!"

I went through all the steps required to update and everything seemed fine except when I went to Reconcile.  I had a charge account with very few entries.  I have done this proceedure for 15 plus years and always was able to Reconcile without problems.  I reconciled with 2014 and was off by -$30.67.  I triple checked my results and could find no error.  I contacted Quicken, which is a daunting task in itself, and told them of the problem.  They wanted me to manually check my results.  I told them this was a simple reconcile.  I asked for the next tier of service and they begrudingly sent me a link.  The next Customer Rep I sent Windows Screen Shots of all my work and then they paid attention.  They had me check all sorts of menus and could find nothing.  The only thing they said was to sign up and do an electronic download of the account.  I don't like to do this because I don't want Quicken to know my acccounts or anyone to hack Quicken accounts and get my records.  In the end I made an adjustment to my accounts to bring the balance to the correct amount.  I will see what happens next month.  In the mean time I reconciled another of my accounts and I ended up on +$60 this time.

1,"On 11/11/14 I renewed my Norton subcription with the CD product. After installing the CD, it said it was recommended to install ONLINE and so I did. I had to enter my username and password. Norton recongnized the newer version but it didn't update the remaining days (366).  Once the ONLINE installation was completed. There still was a screen opened by Norton which is the same screen that recommended updating this newer version ONLINE, but I decided to install it using the CD.

The CD took off and installed itself in about 2 minutes. I then went to my Norton Account which was still opened and it was then it showed a 30 day free subcription countdown. Next to that it had ... I think it said a update icon. I clicked onto that and the Countdown changed to 367 days remaining on my new subscription. So, I was happy.

Also, if you've used Norton throughout the years and have other Norton Accounts using old email addresses, the way to delete them is to CHAT ONLINE with Norton by going to their website and contacting their techs, use your old email address when you fill out the form to start the chat, once they get to you, tell them to delete the old account with the old email address and they will do it."

More importantly I wish Intuit would make a REAL MAC version that's equivalent  to the Windows versions. Their previous attempts have not been up to expectations. But, I do believe Quicken is the best of the home accounting programs."
-1,"Intuit is a despicable company now. This is the same that company came out with really functional and reasonably priced products in early 1990's like Quicken, Quickbooks & Turbotax.

But somewhere in late 1990's this company was taken over by the same crooks who run the Wall Street. Instead of attracting users to upgrade to their product's new versions by improving them, like Apple does, the nitwits at Intuit blackmail you to upgrade to newer versions of Intuit products by taking away the functionality of earlier versions. For example they are blackmailing users into upgrading to Quicken 2009 by dropping support for online banking in earlier versions; and to Quickbooks 2009 by dropping support for payroll in earlier versions.

Now Intuit's motto is to gouge the customers as much as they can by hook or crook (mostly) by extorting them to upgrade to a poorly functional and buggy newer version.

1. They are forcing Quicken users to upgrade to 2009 version by blackmailing them: dropping support for online banking in earlier versions.

2. The newer version, Quicken 2009, is poorly functioning & buggy (as detailed by other reviewers too), not a better product.  The program shuts down every time I try to accept an individual downloaded transaction. The only way to stop that is to click on ""Accept all""

2. Periodically the programs refuses to read the file and I have to restore the backup file. I used to backup once a month with earlier versions and now I do it every time I exit the program.

4. Online support to download transactions is also limited: for example I cannot download transactions for my credit card from Charles Schwab Bank.

5. After the upgrade they provide very limited technical support. For all practical purposes there is no technical support. They do not even provide a tech support phone number to call. You can contact them from the web site when they provide you with a useless ticket number. Instead they direct to Quicken User Communities. After taking your money, they want other users of Quickbooks to provide you with technical support!

6. So Intuit got your money, you got a buggy software with poor functionality, and no technical support. You cannot even do now what you were able to do in an earlier version. You paid money to go from a functioning product to a buggy software.

What a trade off! Basically Intuit screwed you.

Purchasing Quicken is, of course, just the beginning of the upgrade ordeal. Real nightmare starts when  you start getting all those error messages.  After you install Quicken 2009, you will find that it has become cluttered with useless features that you do not even need.  At the end you are left with the feeling: Intuit has screwed me.

Every time you deal with Intuit, you will be left with a bad taste and hate for this company.  Not only they blackmail you into upgrading, every time you have to pay the full price of newer version, there is no upgrade price. And you can get Quicken cheaper at Amazon than buying from Intuit directly.

I hate dealing with Intuit and dumped their Turbotax for Taxact in 2004 and was planning to dump Quicken for Mint. And now they have purchased Mint!  What are the alternatives to Quicken? Please leave your response in the comments section and help us dump Quicken."

1,"Did my homework on these network-through-your-household-wiring things, and was skeptical.  Found reviews of the Corinex HomeNet Powerline HD200 adapters, found lots of either one-star or five-star ratings, and lots of sob stories about how poor the installation instructions were, and what a terrible ordeal it was to get them installed and working properly.  I needed what they offer, though, so I ordered a pair and braced myself for a terrible experience.

I have to say that the ""2 Minute Installation"" note on the front of the package turned out to be a significant understatement.  It took me at least five minutes to get the adapters cabled, plugged into wall outlets, and synced.  I did exactly what the instructions said to do - six easy steps - and everything worked perfectly.  I didn't have to touch any of our network settings.  I can now stream Netflix movies on my PS3 in an area of our house that has been a dead zone for the signal from our wireless router.  I had resigned myself to spending hours screwing around with these things, and now I can watch movies instead!  Couldn't be happier with this product."
1,"Acronis, rightly, is known in the IT world I occupy as a solid backup and restore player in the business. On servers, I have always relied on Acronis to help me restore everything from the Operating System itself to the application specific data, such as Exchange Server mailbox databases.

I am very pleased to report that Acronis is doing the same thing in the PC market. I did not use the whole-PC recovery, choosing instead to use the Non-stop backup primarily. In this, I found it almost childishly simple to operate. I chose which particular folders I wanted to have a continuous backup of and within minutes, it was running seamlessly. This kind of backup is suggested to be placed onto an external drive, which I have. If the USB drive that I use is not presently connected, non-stop backup does not operate, but will instantly start once you do plug it in.
Unfortunately, within a few weeks of turning it, I mistakenly deleted almost 1GB worth of Word documents, but not only was I able to restore them, I was able to do so for several versions of the documents running back to when I first turned on Non-Stop backup.
I would use the PC backup tools installed on here, but for me, it's easier to re-apply my laptop image and safeguard my data. Interestingly, the re-application of images is exactly how True Image operates as well!

Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill was the first game ever created in the series-and it shows. It is definitely the worst in the series, but it still is able to give quite a fun gaming experience.

Story-The story is that your Aunt Eloise (who is the librarian at a high school) has asked you to come help solve a murder. A boy was pushed down a flight of stairs, and it's your job to find out who did it. It's a very generic story, and it really isn't developed as much as it could have been.

Graphics-They aren't good at all compared to today's graphics, but in the '90s, they were awesome. The backgrounds are 3D, somewhat, but they are VERY grainy. Still, they are done quite well. The characters in this game are cartoon characters and are slightly disappointing visually.

Sound-The music is nice in the game and sets a mysterious mood over the game. The voice acting isn't really good at all, but the background sounds are very nicely done.

Gameplay-This is a first-person point-and-click game. You simply click arrows to determine your direction. This game is a little strange in the fact that at some locations you can look up or down slightly for no apparent reason, but otherwise, it's not too hard to figure out. The puzzles in the game are fairly easy and don't require too much thought. They are mostly just finding objects to interact with other objects later in the game. You can call your friends in order to get hints, but all they do is give you a hint before hanging up; in other words, unlike other games, you cannot have conversations with your friends on the phone. Probably the most annoying aspect of the game is that you have to continuously switch discs as you switch locations in the game, which can be quite annoying.

Fun-It was fun, but it really doesn't have replay value as the others in the series do. It's too boring. It wasn't scary at all, but you can die in the game. If you do, you press second chance and you go back to the scene right before you died.

Length-It seriously took me 3 hours to play and finish. And the constant disc changing factor probably took 20 minutes of that time. It's not long at all.

I recommend this game to fans who are waiting for the next game to come out, but only if you can get it cheap. It's fun, but it is short, and it is a one time thing.

EDIT - There is now a newer version of the game called ""Nancy Drew: Secrets Can Kill Remastered"" that improves the game immensely."

Now that's out of the way. Features are removed. Price has gone up. Privacy issues.

Proceed at your own caution."
1,"Nobody likes viruses and spyware, so those of us who use Microsoft Windows know that antivirus software is essential for online security. With Trend Micro Antivirus + Antispyware, you get very good protection from viruses and spyware. Trend Micro is one of the best. It's always a good idea to update your virus and spyware definition lists because new viruses and spyware are being created on a seemingly basis.

Don't be fooled by the low price. This is quality protection!"
1,I sent this back about two or three weeks ago because it did not work on my computer. I had Kaspersky Anti-Virus on my computer before.
1,I have used Turbo Tax for the last five years and I have had no problems. The Amazon gift card for up to 10% of your return is a great deal.
1,"Worked as promised. It was about the best price I could find. It was a security key only, but since everything, including Norton, is moving ""to the cloud"", this fits right in. I submitted my key and got a year of protection on my currently running two devices, although it was available to install on five devices.."
0.5,"I have a Prime account.  Yesterday, I got the notice of their free music downloads.  Today, the player updated itself and found all the Prime music I selected yesterday.

The player works well, has great sound and album art.  I don't have much experience using the player otherwise as I have only played a song or two since the recent update.  So far, I just use it to access my Prime music."
1,"Honestly, I believe that all AV software is pretty good at providing protection. I have four PC's and I run different AV software on all of them.  Mostly because I get free versions to review.  As of right now I am using McAfee, AVG, Viper and TrendMicro and they all work well.

What I like best about TrendMicro is that is stays out of the way (does not take up too many resources) and it installs and un-installs easily.

I wrestled with Norton and vowed to never, ever use them again. It simply took over my PC and it took forever to scrub it off my system; not so with TrendMicro; it runs very cleanly.

Very nice, great protection and easy on the system.  That's all I want out of a AV package.

PS - it would be nice if this included a Firewall, but that is why we have Comodo!"
-1,"I only use windows xp when Im in my ofice as the company runs on XP.....god help us all.  I bring my macbook pro to work with Mac Office on it and I get more work done saved secure than anything on the Dell Latitude with XP.  Thus far the Latitude sporting XP Pro has lost important documents on me on a regular basis, crashes to many times to count, freezes regularly, is slow as hell, slower to boot up, the mouse drivers/trackpad drivers screw up on a regular basis leaving me without a mouse unless I restart and it doesn't freeze.  I work at large oil companies a lot and I cannot belive they run their process on this crippled, dated, bug ridden, virus laced piece of junk OS.  XP sucks folks, Vista is just as bad and Windows 7 is Vista with a new coat of paint.  If you want a good secure, fast, easy, reliable system use a mac with OSX.  I know you have heard that already and I too was a sceptic for years until I bought a mac and tried it out when Vista and my Compaq presario died a few years back 3 months out of the box.  If you want windows to run stable run it inside a virtual machine or dual boot with mac, it's proven to run better than on any PC due to the cheap hardware used in pc's these days by HP, Compaq, Dell, Acer.  Oh look as I was typing this review on my Macbook Pro the Dell running XP Pro just froze again on start up, shutdown/restart will not work, the keyboard/mouse doesn't respond, I guess I need to remove the battery again.  What a great OS.......garbage."
1,"I'm currently running Windows 7 Ultimate on my laptop (and loving it -- see my other reviews for Windows 7 Home Premium or Professional editions), but I want to point out that unless you want to use BitLocker hard drive encryption, or you want to work in multiple languages, there really isn't any reason to buy Windows 7 Ultimate -- instead, Windows 7 Professional is all you need.

With Windows Vista, Microsoft separated functions between Home Premium and Business so that you had to buy the Ultimate version to get all the media-centric capability of Home Premium, and key business-centric functions like Remote Desktop server and Offline Files & Folders of the Business edition of Vista.

With Windows 7, all that has changed now.  Windows 7 Professional has *all* the media-centric capability of Windows 7 Home Premium, PLUS the business functions.  The ONLY two things you get with Windows 7 Ultimate is the ability to encrypt your hard drive and work in multiple languages.  If you're not doing either of those things presently, and if you have no intention of doing either of those things in the future, then save a little money and buy Windows 7 Professional to get everything the Home Premium has plus all the business functions you're probably used to.

That said, you may still choose Windows 7 Ultimate if you want to do an in-place upgrade (where you keep all your installed programs and settings, rather than reinstall everything).  You can't upgrade from Vista Ultimate to Windows 7 Professional with an in-place upgrade (I tried; it didn't let me).  So if you've already got Vista Ultimate, and you want to do an in-place upgrade to Windows 7, then you'll still want to buy the Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade for a smooth transition.

Looking to do a clean install using this upgrade disk? You can, but here's how. Insert the DVD and choose ""Custom"" to do the clean install. During the install, DO NOT enter your product id or activate Windows -- yet. Instead, you'll finish the clean install, reboot, then use your DVD to do an upgrade of the clean install of Windows 7. Yes, you're upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 7. After you upgrade, then enter your product id and activate Windows. I haven't tried this out personally, but others have and have done so successfully. Add a comment to my review to share your experience if you go this route. Final note: This tip isn't intended to circumvent the stipulations in the licensing agreement for upgrading your computer. If you're not entitled to upgrade (because, say, you're using Windows 95, 98, 2000, or ME), then you must buy the full version. As I tell my kids, ""Just because you can do a thing doesn't mean you should do a thing."" :-)"
0,"Quicken Willmaker Plus 2016 is perfect for someone who wants to create a simple, straightforward will. As advertised, it is quick and easy ... all except for the parts where you need to think about what you actually want, and that is your problem, not the software's.

It looks like it will work well for more complicated wills as well, but not having kids, ample assets, a business, or relatives I hate, I can't say for certain.

Willmaker Plus ships with Nolo Press's ""The Legal Answer Book for Families,"" which addresses legal issues in marriage, divorce, child custody, child support, adoption, children (in general), and elder care. I don't have issues in any of these areas (and hope not to), so I can't say how useful the book is. I will say that it is clearly written, and has what appear to be helpful tips and external links, but it's not a lawyer or a law encyclopedia and will not get you too far beyond the basics.

I have not yet tried the ""bonus"" subscription to Nolo's living trust, but will revise once I've had the opportunity.

Which brings me to a couple of negatives about this product. First, I registered it as instructed, but was then unable to login to retrieve the living trust. This is my fault, because I neglected to record the password. Fortunately, Nolo has the usual capability of resetting your password. Unfortunately, it doesn't work ... or isn't working at the moment. It sends me a reset link, but when I try to use it I'm told that it's expired. Annoying. [This was apparently a temporary glitch; I subsequently received a message with a working link.]

Second, when I ran through the process of installing Willmaker and creating a simple will (with plans to get a bit more baroque later, after I had spent the time to think through some issues), I was running on a PC that had recently upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10. I subsequently did a clean install of Win 10, and now I get a ""This App Can't Run on Your PC"" message. Clearly, it can run on my PC, but I need tech support to help me get it going.

I will revise this review once I've heard back from Quicken/Nolo on these issues and (I hope) given the living trust and its associated resources a try.

General comment on Nolo: There is nothing comparable to Nolo as a source of legal advice and guidance that is accessible to the general public. They have a well-earned reputation as a reliable source of legal information. On the other hand, their online materials are not all you could hope for. Their ""free legal updates"" tend to be very skimpy, and the related blogs (where they advertise them) tend to have a handful of old posts and nothing else.

General comment on Quicken: These guys are not exactly a model company. Customer support for Willmaker Plus 2016 will only last until the end of the year, assuming they give it the same treatment as Willmaker Plus 2015. By insisting that you must buy a new product every year, they are pushing customers away.

Bottom line: If you have a big and/or complicated estate, you should probably turn to your lawyer and your tax adviser instead of a piece of software. If your financial and legal affairs are relatively simple, however, Willmaker Plus could be a good choice for you. Customer support is not marvelous, however, and if you want to revise your will next year and you want it to reflect any relevant changes in the law, you will need to buy next year's version."

1,"I've used NIS for the past several years and have been very happy with its performance.  I know I can get cheaper or even free security tools, but I honestly don't mind paying for good software.  However, I'm always on the hunt for good deals and NIS is often available for a very low price or even free after rebates.  You just have to keep your eyes peeled, then jump on it when you see the deals.  The thing is, you are buying the license, so you can use the new license to renew your subscription when your current one expires.  You're free to update the software to the latest version at any time after it's been released.

NIS takes up minimal resources on my PC, which has 16GB of RAM.  I like that after you've installed it and set up a few preferences, it runs in the background without any further interaction required.  I also like that I can install the same license on three machines, since I have more than one Windows PC.  Digging around the interface can get a little confusing and I think it could use a redesign to be more intuitive, but again, I rarely have to mess with it so it's not that big of a deal to me.

If you want a powerful, set-it-and-forget-it security program for your Windows PC, Norton Internet Security is a great option."
-0.5,"I cannot recommend this product.  The performance is bad on my Quad Core, 8GB, 64 bit system and feature set is too light

Corel has done a nice job providing a clean interface that is shared across the prodcut set. The software will index your images and videos on your computer when it work.  I pointed the software to my images folder and it failed to add about half of the subfolders. You create slideshows and videos, the burn to a DVD that you can send to your family.  The photo editing options are pathetic. (Sepia / B&W and little else)

Corel had really butchered the Ulead product line.  Yes these are the express version of the main productss but there is just not enough features to justify paying more than $30 for this prouduct. You are better going with the Adobe Photoshop Elements / Adobe Premiere Elements or using free products.  Google has done a great job with Picasa by the way.."
1,It's TurboTax - It Works!!
0,"I'm erasing my former review, writing a new one, and changing my rating from 2-STARS to 3-STARS (meaning okay).  I think the program may possibly be doing what it claims so I also purchased usage for a second year.

I gave one of my older computers to a neighbor kid and used Drive Scrubber to remove everything from the hard drive.  I then used the software that came with the old computer to restore it to a like new condition.  I don't actually know if criminal investigators, or information hackers, can restore any of the erased data or not.  But for me, at least in this instance, it doesn't matter.

But understand, I cannot prove that the program actually works.  For sure, its not perfect.  For one thing, when I analyze a disk before erasing deleted data, its result is over-printed on the text and cannot be read.  This is clearly a glitch in the program.  It existed in the first copy I installed, and it exists in the new copy I installed after removing the first - even after downloading the newest version.  This glitch of course, could be caused by my own computer or other software corrupting the program.  I just don't have the computer knowledge to know one way or the other.

Anyway, the program is cheap, uses little computer resources, and may be performing as advertised.  I just cannot know for sure.  You pay your money and you take your chances."
1,"As with any video editing software, it takes time to learn how to use it and get the most out of it.  If you do that with this system, you will find it is easy to use and very powerful.

I have a variety of video editing programs and I really enjoyed working with this Pinnacle Studios system.  The Ultimate would probably be better, but I found that I could do most things very easily and effectively with Plus.  Take the time to learn it.

Highly recommended!"
1,"PC Tools Spyware Doctor 2009 v6.0 is incredibly straightforward and easy to operate.  Once the software was installed, I could use program right away, rather than having to comb through a lengthly manual.
After running the program, it discovered many bugs that other programs that I have used missed.
I especially like the real-time feature.  I feel much more comfortable knowing that my computer is safe at all times.
I highly recommend this program and am sure that others will find it easy and thorough."
0.5,"Don't know know I ever got by without it. 10 plus years, but wish I could have stuck with older version, I really don't need all the other bells and whistles that come with it. I had to upgrade so I could download credit card charges"
0.5,"I have been using Quicken for years, and saving time downloading bank, credit card, investment, and  other financial data. Quicken worked well with all my accounts from the mid-1990's until a couple years ago, when Bank of America downloads no longer worked. Everything else still works fine, but there seems to be an impasse between the Quicken and Bank of America technicians and I suspect it's the security folks on both sides. For Quicken's inability to work with BAC, I give the program a 4 instead of a 5. I have found that, because of the way I budget each year (duplicating the past year's data for all accounts), that I can reconcile my BAC accounts just about as easily by simply comparing my Quicken and BAC account screens. I am ticked at BAC for its side of this impasse, especially since they stonewall me when I ask ""why are you making this my problem?"" Unfortunately, bank accounts are ""sticky"" and I would have to reprogram many direct deposit streams and bill payment streams to change banks. And there is nobody producing a replacement program for Quicken which has the same functionality or track record, so I suffer on with it."
1,worked great
1,"I've given this five stars not as a review of Windows 8 itself, but of the upgrade product and its installation process.

Basically if you know you want to upgrade to Windows 8, then you can rest assured that this is a good way to do it assuming you're on Windows 7 to begin with.

If you hate Windows 8's guts, then you won't be interested in this to begin with. Personally I have been hoping that 8.1 would resolve the issues, but so far that's sounding like only a partial solution. I can survive in Windows 8, but on a desktop system it's a struggle to get used to the ""tablet style"" user interface that it forces on you each time you want to start a program. Fortunately there are 3rd party addons that will restore the Start button and bypass the Metro UI at startup.

1,"No hassles to install an implement.  It's quite simple and a security that does not cause lag on resources.  It's not anti-virus, it's peace of mind that your login and encoded information is protected.

There are so many wi-fi hot spots out there that it's becoming a necessity for many business and social establishments to provide it.  But at what cost?  Do you risk an idiot in the vicinity logging your every move? Norton, the leader in security for many years, has your back.

You are limited to registering 5 devices, but it's perfect for me.  I have all my Apple iThings safe, including my iPad, iPhone, iPod, as well as my iMac and Mac Book Pro... so I am set to go.

Great for the coffee shops a godsend for use on public transit and hotels.  I have not used it on my Windows based products, but I have not used Windows for much of anything lately with all the changes.  But for what it does for me, it's quite a bargain for this peace of mind."
1,This is the best Windows operating system ever. It works with legacy software. All the functions are in familiar places.
1,"I researched reviews, tech specs, drives for the last two years before I settled on this product.

QNAP has one of the best reputations in the industry for quality and workmanship.  This has an extremely low power draw and I've acheived write speeds of 65 MB a second over gigabit ethernet which is far greater than USB 2.0 (roughly 25 MB a second).

This product is half the price of a TS-459 Pro+ ($900 before tax).

I bought all enterprise drives for additional reliability (WD RE4) I'm currently upgrading to Hitachi Ultrastar 3 TB drives.  The new firmware (3.4) from QNAP provides support 3 TB drives.  So max would be 6 TB for Raid-1, 12 TB for (JBOD, RAID 0), and somewhere inbetween for Raid 5.

Good luck and don't forget to get a UPS to protect your data in case of a power outage!"
-1,"i'm updating a prior review.

Since I bought this product Intuit has discontinued development of Quicken. They are supposed to sell it to some other vendor. I've never seen a software sale of this magnitude work. For that reason alone this would be a two star rather than three star purchase.

What takes it down to 1 star is that today I'm getting Quicken emails about spending patterns. I did not (knowingly) enable online access to my accounts.

Don't use this product.

--------
The market for personal finance software is not what it was 15 years ago. It is now a niche market. (The reason why that happened is beyond the scope of an Amazon review.)

I am sure nobody would develop Quicken for Windows (the gold standard) today. It's development was funded in a different era, including the painful process of establishing connections to banks. So we can't compare a new product (Quicken for Mac 2015) to that product. If you want all those features you need to run windows in a Mac VM or do dual boot.

So we compare this product to using a spreadsheet (ugh) or iBank 5. Unfortunately that's a very hard comparison to make. I mentioned this was a niche market -- I've not seen any serious head-to-head comparisons from a trusted source.

I opted for this product assuming it leveraged the bank connectivity network funded by Quicken for Windows. It does indeed do that.

It is not a stellar product. It desperately, desperately, needs a manual -- but the finance market is now so small that even niche ePublishers won't write a guide for it. Installation and configuration was quirky. Manual setup of 529 and other non-integrated investment tools is weird. I ran into several UI bugs and usability issues.

There's no Help file.

On the other hand, after initial setup it's bringing data in from a variety of investment sources and multiple US bank accounts. That's something.

I think it's worth the money. A manual might even make it four stars."

After about 3 months of work in my spare time, my opinion is that Windows 8 with Outlook, Hotmail, Live Id and Microsoft Account are totally unusable.  We were very happy with Windows 7 and MSN email.  It has been impossible for me to get our three systems to provide the same usable function that the Windows 7 Systems provided.  Because of the password security system, and its unpredictable results when interfacing, I have had to restore the Dell Desktop, and Asus notebook to factory defaults.  Even after doing that, I spent about 6 hours trying to get an email system to work on the notebook.  We still do not have a workable email system on any of the 3 systems.  The contact list is there for only one email address.  My wife is so frustrated that she is in tears every time she tries to do the three simple functions that she wants on her Asus.

1,"""Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus"", from Corel Corp., downloaded to my 64bit PC without incident. The program started up quickly and has an intuitive, and familiar, appearance; hovering over most button choices causes an explanatory pop-up. The ""Help"" menu  provides a downloadable 'User Manual' and 'Sample Movie' in addition to links for updates, forums, and support. For the purpose of this review I emailed for support and was surprised at the very quick, and helpful, response.

Although very familiar with a variety of sophisticated photography programs I'm a novice at video creation and 'Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus' is the only program I've had the opportunity to try. I found the 'User Manual' explicit, easy to read and understand, and enormously helpful. There's also an included 45 day access pass to Pinnacle's 'Studio Backlot' where you'll find a host of tutorials. And there are also tutorials available on 'YouTube'.

I've found this program easy to use as it employs familiar actions like drag and drop, but, it also has a learning curve that requires a bit of time and practice to acquire proficiency. After using Pinnacle Studio 18 Plus, off and on, for a few weeks I'm no where near the professional I'd like to be. However, I am confident I'll get there."
0.5,"Getting WordPerfect Office is like visiting with an old friend.  More than 30 years ago, I had the responsibility of evaluating word processors for a company that is now in the S&P 500.  Back then, Wordstar was the 800 pound gorilla but I chose WordPerfect.  One if its most endearing features was the Reveal Codes key.  No matter how screwy your document looked, you could press the Reveal Codes key and see what exactly was making it look that way.  I LOVE that WordPerfect still does this and I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT UNDERSTAND why competitors like WORD do not have a similar function.  Sure you also want to see how your document will look with WYSIWYG but if you want to fix the appearance then you also need to know what is making it look that way.  You also get very strong backward compatibility.
The same applies to Quattro Pro (or as I used to call it ""Quattro Perot"" when Ross Perot was showing us graphs during his presidential run).  This is a very near substitute for Excel (in fact I think it performs better) - the only problem is that it will not import Excel Macros - and that can be a deal killer for some people.  If you are not one of those people this package is a steal - and it works on 3 computers."

0,"I have been using Pinnacle Studio since version 9. It has been the easiest to use, most intuitive video editing software out there. Earlier versions had problems with the program crashing, and unless the video was constantly saved, any work was lost when it crashed. In 2005 Pinnacle was sold to Avid, which is the Rolls Royce of digital video editing. Most multi-million dollar feature films use Avid editing technology, just look at the credits. Avid cleaned up the code behind the scenes, making the program usable! It stopped crashing, and even if it did, somehow, Studio managed to save all of your work so once the computer was rebooted you could get back to work right where you left off. Under Avid, video rendering speed improved, the user interface improved without any drastic changes, and Studio became a reliable program. Avid did a nice job with Studio, and kept the system requirements fairly minimal. Up until version 15 I was able to use a Pentium 4 2.80GHz Hyperthreading processor running Windows 7 with decent results.

In July 2012 Pinnacle was sold to Corel, and they have made a few changes to the Studio program. The saddest change for me is that I am no longer able to use my Pentium 4 2.80 GHz computer using this program anymore, the system requirements are just too great that program barely runs on this system. I have tested Studio on a laptop with an i5 processor and it works better, but I expected even faster performance than I got. The rendering with an i5 processor is pitifully slow.  I'm afraid you might need a supercomputer to get fast rendering speed with Studio 16 Ultimate!

Corel also drastically changed the user interface as well. The once easy to use intuitive interface is gone, replaced by their own confusing library, timeline, effects control and disc interfaces. Sadly, the learning curve is great if you have used Studio products in the past as you enter unfamiliar territory with Corel's version of Pinnacle Studio Ultimate. To Corel's benefit they do include an instructional DVD entitled ""Getting Started With The New Pinnacle Studio"", and there is a step by step Quick Start Guide, but the beauty of the old interface was that you could just sit down and use it, it was that intuitive.

As with all Studio Ultimate Editions you get a great collection of effects, transitions and plug ins. Version 16 includes Red Giant Magic Bullet: Looks, Mojo, Cosmo, Knoll Light Factory, Warp, Shine and Particular as well as a huge library of transitions, filters and effects, all of which take a long time to render.  It also takes about 6 GB of Hard Drive space and about an hour's time for a full installation. Studio 16 even includes a green screen for compositing and special effects. You can even make 3D videos in this version. Truly the amount of stuff you get for the money is impressive. Studio also includes 50GB of free storage on Box to share and store your videos in the cloud. Using Box you can go back and forth with your videos on the iPad if you have Studio for iPad.

As a previous Pinnacle Studio user I am somewhat disappointed with Studio 16. It seems like you really need a beefed up system to get anything done, you need to learn a new interface with new controls, what they do, where everything is, and it feels like you are starting from scratch. Maybe I just feel a bit overwhelmed over the differences between versions. After watching the tutorial DVD I know that I need to become more familiar with this version, and maybe I will like it better.  I just wanted to warn previous Studio users that Pinnacle Studio 16 is much different than the Studio you were used to."

I searched about this error in the Internet, and I realized that many users is suffering from the same error. [The licensing data for Office 2016] is very fragile, despite very high licensing fee.

When we use Microsoft Outlook, A weather report is compulsorily displayed in the center of the upper part of the screen. This is an absolute deterioration. The very useless information is displayed in the most important place. It is too user-experience.

Many icons are made into monochrome. In Office 2010, users can distinguish many icons with their color. So, Office 2016 became very inconvenient. It is too user-experience.

Excel 2016 often displays an error [Operation was stopped] and it is forced to terminate.

<FAQ (Frequent Answers and Questions)>
Question: You recommend Office 2010, but the support term is shorter than later version.

Amswer: No problem. Any problem cannot be found, even if the support period passes. Because this is a typical sales promotion called [a support end fraud].

Microsoft always forces purchasing latest products for end of support period. However, how many injury occured? The answer is [zero]. You can confirm it with retrieving the information in the Internet. Informational underdogs are being deceived by the sales promotion. Even if you suffered from a victim, the amount of damage is much less than [the cost of the installation for the useless software].

Now, which is you, an informational winner, or an informational loser?"
1,"We have 2 of these as our backbone for our 70 machine office. They are a bit noisy, but their performance is perfect.

Main points:
-Does not need to be a ""managed"" switch.
-Easy plug and go.
-Light enough to put into a U1 rack spot with just the from brackets.
-Uses standard UNC power cable.
-Fans make a little noise. Good enough to hide in a room, but not in an open space next to office workers."

0.5,"I had some apprehension about getting this particular virus protection software as I had some bad experience with the 2009 version. However, I have to say that I was a lot more impressed with this than I was ever with 2009. Bitdefender 2009 brought me nothing but heartache and brought my computer down because of different incompatibility issues with other software.

The installation of 2010 was very easy and it had even let me keep using my 2009 key if I wanted to. I had installed this on three different Operating Systems: two running Windows 7 and one running Windows XP. The first Windows 7 installation did encounter some problems but I was able to let it do a scan of my computer and then re-installed and it worked fine. The Windows XP one had the 2009 version on it and it went very fast without any problems. I had found that after installing 2010 on the Windows XP, that I had a lot less bugs than before. However, since my computer was just bogged down with too much applications and files on it, I did a new install of Windows 7. With the newest Windows 7, I installed 2010 and again, no problems whatsoever. It was smooth and ran very fast. In fact, I barely notice the antivirus running.

The backup is very easy to setup. Just note that the online backup is only for a limited amount of time. I believe it is for one year. All of the other features work great and the new look is so much better than before. It's less bulky and more attractive.

Overall, I am happy with this product and has provided a lot less hassle for me than last year's version. If you are apprehensive about getting this because of issues with 2009, rest assured it is a great improvement."
0,"I have mixed feelings about this product.  It has bailed me out from a C: disk crash.  However, I had many issues with the software (I will give examples below), support for problems is practically non existent (help only from the forums where other people are having the same issues)  and when the crash happened I had very little hope that it would work. But it did.  I now switched to a different back up method.

When I bought this software (started with 2009 then upgraded), I wanted to have a backup history of about a month so I can go back to the old files if I made some sort of mistake.  My hope was to run a full back up once a week, and then have differential backs 6 times a week, this way I could fit 7 different backups on a large disk designated for backups.  The software claims to have a function that allows it to delete old backups based on a condition (% of disk full for example).  But that never worked. Many other people complained about the same problem.  When the disk became full, it simply stopped backing up.  I had to remember to manually free up disk.

Then I upgraded to a next version of the software which was supposed to have these problems fixed.  However, the fix was to remove the functionality and what I wanted to do was not possible.  The new version still had problems with incremental backups at disk full situation.  In fact I left it double the amount of space necessary for one backup (as the forums indicated it needs temporary space while the backup is working).  Finally, the only solution that worked was to have a full back up every day, with a rule that the previous copy had to be deleted before the new backup was created.  Occasionally, it would still fail with messages that made no sense at all.  I could get it to work again sometimes, if I deleted several backups and ran disk defragmenter. But this did not always help.  And then in a few days it would begin working again.  So it felt fragile and unreliable.

As I was having various issues I contacted support several times (support is via email), they would get back to me in 2-3 weeks requesting some additional log file, to which they would respond maybe in another 2-3 weeks.  By then whatever they said was not relevant, because I could not just wait for 4-6 weeks for a possibly helpful response. I would just wipe out the backups and start all over.

Because the regular backups felt flakey, I also created ""secure zone"" back up, which is an option to have a backup on a separate partion.  When the disk crashed, restore from secure zone did not work.

So overall, using it was a very frustrating experience which was shared by a large number of other users based on the forum postings.  The forum was the only place where I could get ideas of for possible solutions, and validation that the problems I was having were not unique to me.

However there are some positive things about the product
1.  The feature that allows you to mount a back up and easily retrieve an old file as if it was just another volume is very nice
2.  The backups are fairly quick. I tried using Windows native back up and on my disks it did not even completed in 24 hours.  Acronis backup for all my disk completed overnight (when it worked), when it did not it would sit at the prompt complaining about something with inscrutable message.
3.  Finally, when the disaster struck and my c: drive crashed, I was able to do a restore my C: drive from the backup to a brand new drive and it worked.  I did not have to reinstall windows, all my settings and customization were preserved.

Bottom line, this is only for those who have no other options.  It requires constant baby-sitting.  You need to manually check if it worked on daily basis, delete files, and  just pay constant attention to it.  But what you want from a backup is to enable it and forget it until you need it."

0,I bought this because I had a two computer subscription that was already in use so I needed another one for a third computer. It's easy enough to use the key card. My biggest gripe is the fact that I had to create a whole new account. I couldn't just add this to my existing account. That's annoying. You can only have one subscription at a time.

We should cover a few things about the editions before we review Vista. ""Starter"" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. ""Home Basic"" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. ""Home Premium"" has limited networking interaction. ""Vista Business"" has the extended networking interaction. ""Vista Enterprise"" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. ""Ultimate"" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.

Installing Vista is very easy. This can be easily demonstrated by giving a child the DVD and a blank computer and saying ""install that"". Come back 5 minutes later and play with Vista. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. ""Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor"" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the ""gadgets"" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's ""widgets"" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called ""Konfabulator"", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures.  Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard (""Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?"" ""Oh yeah, the documents folder!""), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.

Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.

99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.

XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.

The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing. You will be very pleased at experiencing the rush of a new OS once again."
1,I have been using TaxCut/H&R Block for at least 10 years.  It is very straight forward.  Last year I had a unique problem entering some new data for a farm rental property and called they Tech Support group who were very helpful and sorted out the situation.
1,Received product on time. Product is as advertised. Would recomend this product to a friend. Do not have any negative comments about this product. Have used TurboTax for several years now and have been completely satisfied. Very easy to follow instrustions that guide you through all of the tax forms.
0,"I guess this thing is designed to be used by someone with an RV, big van, or something with a lot of room in the front, cause this is just not working out in a car.  With the laptop sitting on the passenger seat you really have to look away from the road a bit too long to check the map.  I like to see the map, not just listen to the voice tell me the directions.  I suppose if you had a passenger they could hold the laptop on their lap the whole trip and help you navigate.  I think the GPS/laptop combo is just too cumbersome to use if you are taking a trip in a car.  Buy the Streets & Trips without the GPS, or buy a dedicated GPS unit."
0.5,"I want to start out by saying that I absolutely love and trust the McAfee suite of products that have protected all of  my Windows PCs for many years, now. They have great anti-virus software, a solid firewall, and email protection that cannot be beat. Total Protection 2016 works just as well as Mcfee Internet Security 2015. The software loaded easily to my PCs and the user interface is easy to use, whether you are a seasoned McAfee subscriber like myself, or new to the product.

Where I think McAfee fell off the mark is in their marketing this product as ""protection for every device you own"". All of the ""protection"" that this package provides for my both my Android phone and tablet are already provided by other apps (eg. Data Backup I already have through Google, Anti-theft through Samsung built into my phone, Wi-Fi protection I don't need since I don't use unsecured networks, etc.). And we do have one iPhone in our household, but the only things McAfee provides for iOS devices is Anti-Theft (again, already have Apple's app) and File Protection which is simply file encryption, which Apple already provides. I don't want nor even need these protections/apps, which will only take up room on my phone and tablet. I believe that will probably also hold true for the majority of users.

For myself, the version of this software that is for 3 devices would have been just fine, as that is the total number of Windows PCs I need to protect, and, is also much less expensive to purchase. It can be found here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/McAfee-Total-Protection-2015-3-Devices-PC-Key-Card/dp/B00MUTAY2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">McAfee Total Protection 2015 | 3 Devices | PC Key Card</a>. In summary, 5 stars for the protection this software provides for PCs, but McAfee as a company was marked down a star for the misleading marketing regarding their ability to offer any unique (and actually, needed) protection for Android and iOS devices."
1,"I can highly recommend this product.  I had tried earlier generations of dictation software, but this is a technology that has matured to a very usable product.  I had a paper only document that had I had to get into a digital format.  I considered scanning and using an OCR conversion process, but the paper was old, and faded.  I picked up this product, and was very pleased with the outcome.  You spend a short time training the software by speaking, then in a short time you are ready to go.  The recognition rate was every bit the rate that the manufacturer claims.  I am very satisfied with Dragon Dictate."
0.5,"Autodesk products have never failed to impress me, and the same holds true for AutoCAD 2012, although I must say that the improvements in this version seem to be more incremental than ""new"".

The PDF and DGN input/output tools have been updated, and make collaboration a lot easier than before, but I was hoping that this version would include at least some basic 3D elements.  Unfortunately, not.  So be aware, this is a 2D program only.

But as far as 2D CAD programs go, this is still far and above the best. The menus are extensive, and perhaps overwhelming at first, but after you've worked in the program a while you'll see that menu layouts and positioning are quite logical, making it relatively easy to find a function when you need it.

One of the ""new"" features is the ability to access your designs on a mobile device.  I'm not sure I would want to try and view a design on a smartphone, so I'm not quite sure what advantage this affords.  However, on an iPad, perhaps you can get a good enough overview of a project to show a client remotely.  I didn't try this feature, but it appears more of a ""me-too"" bell and whistle than a truly practical feature.

From a practical standpoint, this software is an excellent tool for engineers and designers to use in the creation of 2D plans, and provides a tremendous amount of flexibility to quickly create solid designs that facilitate accurate final plans."
-1,"The worst thing you could do to your business is install windows vista on any of you machines. Vista is a bloated, slow, buggy piece of junk that could ruin your business. Stick with XP and don't even think about Microjunk vista. I would give it zero stars as a rating, if I could. May bill gates burn inhell."
1,"I've been a serious photographer for more than fifty years. Back in the day, using filters was expensive, inconvenient, unpredictable and irreversible. You could practically win an award at a photo show for any successful creative use of filters in your print.

 I started using this package when it was first developed by another company. I've continued to use it through the present day - and I also use its primary competitor from Nik Software.

 Am I nuts? No. I use both programs sparingly and only when I want to a) achieve a very specific effect or 2) play.

 Tiffen DFX has an interface that only a masochist could love, but after some tinkering and manual reading, it is usable. Ultimately - and you should know this going  in - the learning curve is steep.

 What you begin with are 125 individual filters, each of which can be manipulated with sets of parameters. In other words, the possibilities are infinite. I have never, ever been able to open this program, do what I intended to do and move on with my life. Instead, each and every time, I get caught up in playing with the endless variations that are possible. I am forever amazed at what you can do with an image, with a little tweak there and another here. Some addicted to Solitaire: I could be easily addicted to Tiffen DFX.

 A program like this cannot really be described in words. Just in preparing to write this review, on a program that I have been using for years in various versions, I spent more than a half-hour just playing with some of the features.

 There are other tools as well, particularly a masking tool from the original creators of the program.

 If you're serious about your photography - or just want to make Instagram effects look like pre-school exercises - you ought it to yourself to at least demo Tiffen DFX. It is available as both a plug-in for popular image editing programs or, as this, as standalone version.

-1,I wouldn't normally suggest this but do not upgrade!  Vista takes the only good thing about Microsoft products - which is the advantage of an interface that you already know - and breaks it.  Vista really is different than any of the previous versions of windows but in the worst of ways.  Here's a typical example.  Want to do something simple like search for a file?  Too bad!  They have a much faster version of search with just one problem - no place to enter the search criteria.  Overall I think that the only people who have gained from Vista are Apple and Linux users since there should be more defections with the Vista fiasco.
-1,"I truly did wish to have the opportunity to test ""Corel VideoStudio Pro X4 Ultimate"", however, no matter how I tried it would not install to my HP Win Vista Laptop; each time an error 1935 window pops up and a suggestion to call help & support for more information. I subsequently made the point to read the EULA and, sure enough, there's an indication the program will not work w/Win Vista. So be it. And I am not happy, as others have noted regarding information obtained by ""Corel"" through use of the program."

I also want it to not pop up and ask me questions every time I run a program.

1,I love these programs and have had different ones for the last few years. Each time the new one can do a little bit more. I like this one because of the text wrapping so I can do scrapbooking and because of the ability to be able to move objects into different backgrounds. I had a little trouble learning it at first but with practice you get better. They have good directions to help you with it.  Corel is a good program and fairly simple to learn and I've never had any trouble with any of their products. I just love how you can take an old torn up picture and make it look great. I do a lot of genealogy and make up family history books for people and  this program has helped me tremendously. People just can't get over how a 100 year old picture can look so great!
0.5,"Sage 50 Complete Accounting installs easy on Windows 8.  The software is quite comprehensive.  You can invoice customers by mail or email, monitor cash flow to meet current or upcoming payments and devise your own reports (although there are over 100 built in reports).  Check writing, purchasing, bank reconciliation, project tracking, serialized inventory, billing, job costing, and audit trails are all included.  Multi-user options are available, and you can access information quickly via customized dashboards. The inventory and cash flow management screens are clear and easy to understand.  Sage payroll and credit card processing is also available.

1,"We used this exclusively with Windows pcs/laptops for large file tranfers, solving a problem that had plagued us for several years--Send Stuff Now means that we are no longer aggravated when we need to transfer large files such as video footage or audio files via the internet.

It's convenient.  When we have the file ready to send, regardless of what time it is at the destination end, we can send it.  No more trying to juggle time zones so that we can do a file transfer, no worries about files being diverted or inadvertently accessed by unauthorized computers either.  We send it, and the information on retrieval can be given to the recipient via telephone, fax, email or even text messages.  They retrieve it at a convenient time, and everyone is happy.

It's reliable.  We've not had a single file become corrupted or lost.  With 100% accuracy, we feel secure in the knowledge that the file will arrive intact, giving us peace of mind.

Granted, it's not cheap.  But we haven't found a cheap solution to the large file transfer yet that is nearly this accurate or easy.  Often in the past we would spend hours attempting to successfully transmit a file, only to have it fatally error at the end, resulting in lost effort, time and productivity, and causing the entire process to repeat itself.  This is particularly irritating when either you or the recipient is up in the middle of the night to do this transfer!  With SendStuffNow, there are no more irritating and slow uploads to error.

How ""expensive"" it is also depends on how many transfers are regularly done by your company.  For efficiency, reliability, simplicity, and security, it's a five star program.  Cost is something that can only be determined by your usage level and is very individual.  Personally, I'd say go with SendStuffNow if you do more than 3 large file transfers per month average."
-1,"It seems that it usually takes Microsoft two tries to get things right with O/S's (operating systems) nowadays!  Windows 7 righted the fiasco of Vista and hopefully by October of 2013 ""Windows Blue"" aka Windows 8.1 will right Windows 8 or Metro without additional charge.

What is good about Windows 8:

In one word: fast.

What is not so good about Windows 8:  (oh boy...)

1.  The Metro interface is a mess for use on a desktop! Touch screen and the Metro interface is fine for tablets and phones, but for a desktop, most people want ease of use and they just want it to work.  Perhaps for a touch screen all in one computer, it might be ok.  For a desktop with a keyboard, mouse, and monitor - Windows 8 is a nuisance.  For many users who are upgrading, it is unfriendly and downright unusable.  Unless you are a power user or someone who embraces new ideas quickly, Windows 8 in it's present format is probably not for you.

2.  Microsoft doesn't seem to understand the basics of customer loyalty.  It is a big mistake to take away something you gave in a previous O/S.  Microsoft's ill conceived plan to leave out Windows Media Center and try to charge extra for it in Windows 8 (after the initial limited time give-away) is a huge mistake.  There are indications this will be corrected in Windows 8.1 as well.  Let's hope so!

Now for the big question:  HOW CAN YOU FIX IT?

One way to overcome the Metro interface is to use a free and relatively simple program which restores the desktop interface.  You can research these products by reviews on PCWORLD magazine online.  (Like any other program, you use it at your own risk!)  I chose a program called CLASSIC SHELL by the open source people at Sourceforge.  I am not affiliated with them and I cannot make any statement as to its suitability for you or your computer.  However, they are the people who have developed the popular open source programs VLC and 7-Zip.  The program is working very well for me.

Anyway, if you upgraded or bought a new pc with Windows 8, don't panic!  Once you get the desktop interface back, it is a reasonably good and stable O/S. Hopefully Microsoft has heard the outcry of their customers and have seen the plummeting sales of Windows 8 and new computers and will restore the ability to boot to the desktop interface and restore Windows Media Center as part of the O/S as well.

Happy computing!

Update:  July 14, 2013.  Although the Windows 8.1 update will be free, I still cannot recommend Windows 8 or 8.1 for the following reasons.

First, let the user decide whether they want to have a desktop or a mobile pc experience.  This means fully restoring the desktop menu system rather than providing a semi-functional start button.

Second, Windows Media Center needs to be part of the operating system and not some very expensive extra cost add-on.  Home theater computers are very popular and a great way to enjoy movies and music.  Windows Media Center must be restored as a standard feature to Windows 8.

Unless Microsoft wakes up, the rate of adoption of Windows 8 will remain very low.  It is much easier to migrate your Windows 7 operating system to the new computer rather than put up with the cumbersome mess that is Windows 8."
1,Easy to order and check out. Great item and price. Shipping quick as expected. Thanks very professional.
0.5,"I have been using this product for doing taxes for years.  My taxes are not too complicated so doing them myself with the help of this software works very well for me.  The interview process it uses makes it pretty easy to do taxes just by putting in the info the interview asks, which is questions to answer or numbers to insert.  The program takes all this information and places it in the correct Federal form and does all the math.  You can also import information that you have in a financial software such as Quicken as long as you have given the proper categories to all your entries that are tax related.  You can then file electronically up to 5 different returns for no cost since this is part of the products features.  I have never had any IRS issues using this program over the years and have been very satisfied with the ease of use and accuracy of the product.  I usually buy it from Amazon because they seem to have to best price if you are patient and keep checking until the price is right which it always does in time."
1,"I've tried 2 other top selling courses that are substantially more expensive and Instant Immersion is actually superior at a fraction of the price.  First of all, the breadth of the program is wider, with the computer program, tablet App, DVD and audio files.  As such, I can make progress at home or on the go.  In addition, the program has a scoring game that allows you to track progress and gives you identifiable benchmarks in terms of assessing your progress.  Given that this program sells for less that $75, I didn't really expect much, but I was very surprised.  Installation was a breeze and I've encountered no problems so far. In addition, the family license is broad and doesn't freak out if you install in multiple devices."
0.5,"The McAfee Site Advisor utility is designed to keep you informed about potentially harmful websites that appear in search engines so you can avoid them. The software is set-up to report sites that contain spyware, browser exploits and other viruses that could mess with your machine. The sites are indentified by McAfee and the utility comes with a year's subscription to update the list of potentially harmful sites.

The utility is easy to install and takes up little in the way of resources. I run a very recent install of Windows Vista and had no issues setting up the software.

Most computer security software suits include some kind of functionality similar to this, so you really should check your existing security software before purchasing it.

The price is low enough and the software simple and useful enough that I can recommend it for those that don't currently have similar protection."
1,"I use this software for a very specific use-- at my workplace we have a lot of documentation that is quite old and we no longer have the electronic copies due to company buyouts, changing of hands, etc.  This software allows us to scan large volumes of documents with charts, text, graphics and will export it to very editable formats such as RTF.

Over the years software that does this was quite buggy and didn't create documents that ""edited properly,"" for example, the columns would get all out of whack if you tried to edit some text. Formatting is really important, and I'm here to say that this software is far better than anything I've used in the past.

People spent $200 or more for Adobe Acrobat Pro to put documents into ""non-editable"" format, and this is a cheap way to do the reverse-- turn those non editable or paper documents back into a form that can be edited. I'm using this on Windows 7 64 bit with no issues.

I hope to have more specific feedback in the future, but with my initial uses, I've been quite impressed.

----- update ------

There are also some interesting nuance (no pun intended since that's the brand that makes this) uses for the application-- such as-- needing to submit documentation for Health Savings Account purchases, but not really wanting to submit every single detail that the company doesn't need about the medicine I got, or procedure I had... with this you can scan the document in, easily edit out what you don't want to share, and print a fresh copy for documentation submission.

------ update -----

I've also noticed that this software is very *fast* compared to previous tools I've used in the past. You'd never even realize it is crunching away at converting your document. It happens in no time."
0,"As a standalone product, this is a good office suite of tools.  It may take some getting used to if you are switching from Microsoft Office, but one of the nice features is the option to turn on Microsoft-style menus.

Again, this is a nice product at a good price.

The problem is that it has difficulty importing Microsoft Office documents.  The imported documents just do not make it through the conversion in-tact.  I tried with both Word and Powerpoint.  Tables were mangled in the converted Word document and half of my graphics and color scheme (theme) did not survive the conversion.  The Powerpoint was particularly bad and was unusable.  Mind you, these were not complex documents.  They were simply a syllabus and lecture notes for my students.

I know this is sounding pretty negative.  There's just no way around it though.  We live in a Microsoft Office world."
1,"Painter was already a top flight digital media creation suite, so it is tough to think what Corel could do to make this even better, but they did.  While it is virtually identical in look & feel to the previous release, they did add enhancements and make things easier to do. Things like smoke, fire, hair and water are easier to manipulate using the new particle brushes.

It is also noticeably faster to load and run.  This is always a big help and is something I wish that Adobe could also work on. The only real down side is mastering the art of locating all the tools at your disposal - much like previous releases.

So the question comes down to.. is it worth spending money to upgrade?  I would say ""yes"" if you are already a hardcore Painter user.  If you only dabble, then I would say ""pass"".  This is a much better product, but unless you are a gung-ho user it is probably not for you.  If you have never used Painter or have a much older version... then I would say it is worth the purchase.

Final word - this is NOT a photo editor like Photoshop.  To the uninitiated, please keep this in mind.  If you want to be digitally tweaking your photos, you'll want something else.

Nice product, decent improvements, excellent results - I love Painter; always have."

The purchases were made for my teenage daughter, who draws constantly via the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wacom-Bamboo-Create-Pen-and-Touch-Tablet-CTH670/dp/B005HGBF9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wacom Bamboo Create Pen and Touch Tablet (CTH670)</a>&nbsp;and on paper.  She has enjoyed playing with animation software in the past, but up until Anime Studio Pro 8, she was never able to have her drawings traced and animated.  This software will do it, but it takes a lot of time to figure out 'how'.

This would be the negative to this software for the novice to intermediate user.  A tough learning curve that requires weeks, if not months of learning before you feel comfortable using it.  Some would argue that this is the case with most high-end software whether it relates to animation or not.  I would tend to agree, but it can be a con for some.

The positives to this software are many.  It can be used by PC or MAC users, offers the ability to bring your drawings to life, automatically lip-syncs your audio to the drawings, and allows you to import Photoshop files.

The Character Wizard is perhaps the easiest way to get started using the Anime Studio Pro 8 software, as you'll see results quickly and with the least amount of frustration.  Experts won't care about it, but if you're buying this to have fun with your computer and/or kids, start with with wizard!

The software is feature-rich with tweaks to color schemes, brush sizes, and layers (similar to Photoshop) which was expected.  What wasn't expected was the ability to do 3D renderings to share on YouTube.  Pretty cool stuff!  The ability to upload your creations to Facebook and YouTube is a fun perk.

Advanced users will love the ability to script their own tools and add-ons for the program, but frankly, this user will never get to that point!

All the major video formats are supported, with output up to 1080p and even in 3D.

Made for professional digital artists and animation professionals, Anime Studio 8 is loaded with amazing features and delivers what it promises on that front.

If you do not fall into that category of user, you may find it overwhelmingly hard to learn anything but the basics through the wizard.  You can learn more than that on your own, but it takes time in the form of a lot of reading and hands-on trial and error.  If you're brave enough to give it a try, and can commit to learning it, you'll be rewarded."
0.5,"The main reason to use Microsoft Office is to take advantage of its ubiquity, and the huge investment - for better or worse - that people have made in learning how to use it.

So the two great advantages Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac offers are compatibility and productivity:

COMPATIBILITY:  Using the defacto standard means that you can usually readily open the files you receive, and that others can usually open the files you send.  (And if they can't, they will ironically consider that to be their fault, not yours, and make the effort to open the file.  Unless they are paying you!)

PRODUCTIVITY:  Tens of millions of people have invested a lot of hours into learning how to use Microsoft Office - understanding the features, concepts, and quirks.  Choosing Office for Mac takes advantage of that investment.  Of course, if it worked identically to the PC version, that might be the ideal way to take advantage of the experience and training people have.

If those are your goals, you'll be very happy.  If specific features interest you, be sure to check the details before buying."
1,"I bought Microsoft Office 2007 Professional Academic version because I was (and still am) a struggling (with illnesses mostly) college student, and then I took a chance on the Office 2007 Ultimate Steal Microsoft was running. But I realized I needed more than just 2 PCs to read .docx, .pptx, and .xlsx files on, and this proved to be just the ticket. I could evaluate the new versions of the three most commonly used (for me at least) Office programs on 3 computers.

I have it installed on one nearly brand new PC as of right now; but I will eventually install it onto the rest of the eligible PCs if not indeed buy new systems just for this version of Office. I like what I see from Office 2010. It matches the interface of the Windows Live applications, WordPad, and Paint; which the color scheme chosen for 2007 prevented it from doing. I hope to eventually upgtade my everyday school laptop to one with a new-fangled processor, and the 3-install disc will come in very handy.

I got the last copy of this software available at my local Wal-Mart, and it has proven that you don't have to have the highest-end Office suite to be able to get productive work done, whether for school assignmnents or personal use.

I know Office 2003 is better, but my school has long since switched to 2007 and now 2010, so I had to get with it, and not keep using something so outdated on PCs that I hope to earn my college degree with.

In summation, I am keeping Office 2007 Professional and Ultimate around for tasks requiring off-the-wall Office applications, but my daily driver wersion of Office will become 2010, despite the fact I feel like it's 2007 with a new coat of paint."

0.5,"Norton Security Deluxe is the next generation of last year's Norton Security. This package is for 3 devices and at the time of this review is almost twice as much as getting it for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-Deluxe-for-5-devices/dp/B015724OVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security Deluxe for 5 devices</a>!! Go figure. Lesson: It pays to shop carefully for Norton products because often ""more is less"".

The biggest changes I see in this product from last year's Norton product is the branding on the box. To be sure there are incremental improvements. Norton Security Deluxe is like the older Norton Security without  Backup for 5 devices. I think this isn't too bad. I like my security software to evolve and improve more than radically change.

Norton Security Deluxe comes with licensing for 3 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

Buying a new subscription is less expensive than renewing an existing one. This is a long pattern with Norton products and buying new can save quite a bit.

Windows Setup:

**NOTE** If you have Norton Security (with or without backup) installed and you get this new subscription you will need to remove your device from the Norton control panel. In theory this will uninstall the older product from your computer (but not remove the IOS app for iPhone/iPad devices). In my case I had to manually uninstall Norton Security and reboot my computer before I could install the new subscription.

Installation is pushed out of the Norton account control panel. AFTER I removed old versions I was able to install Norton Security Deluxe very easily and without problems. I registered the product in my existing Norton account to activate 5 devices I could install. The download went smoothly and installation on my Windows 7 desktop was faster than with older CD based Norton products and similar to Norton Security. I did have to restart my computer.

I found it interesting that the installation branding and the control panel branding is still Norton Security reinforcing my perception of a simple evolution and mostly branding changes.

The controls in the GUI are simple and clear coming from Norton Security.  There are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. There is a small gear icon for settings on the main screen of the GUI and many controls are hidden in there.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is continues to be ""noisy"" than pre-2015 versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. It has the same light impact on PC performance as the previous version.  This is a very good thing! The initial full scan came up clean which is no surprise ince I had last year's version installed before this one.

Application Compatibility Problems:

Unlike last year's version I have had no application compatibility problems. Last year's version has issues with VirtualBox. Good news!

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is better than before, but not all that much. It has anti-theft features. It does not include any virus protection. The Anti-Theft features include:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 6 a quarter mile away!! Also letting it run GPS in the background significantly reduced my battery life.
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number. If the phone is locked it can't be answered...
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 5 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS does not do much for me and the GPS locator drained my battery. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware. I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:

This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other anti-virus software misses. It does not seem to slow things down noticeably. With this version I had no application problems which is an improvement. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple and there are advanced controls available if you need them.

If you have last years (or older versions) of Norton installed, be sure to remove it from the Norton control panel and device before installing the new version. I could not find a way to move a device from an old subscription to a new one unless I renewed through the Norton site at a higher price. That's annoying.

Because it's a great product for home users, having to reinstall if you buy a new subscription (vs renewing) and the IOS app remains quite limited I'm giving Norton Security Deluxe 4 stars. It a good product with a few gotchas."
1,"This is  great for photo editing and organizing photos. It is fairly easy to use and intuitive in many ways.

I take a lot of photos with my digital camera and have been looking for a better way to organize them. This allows me to easily access my photos from a number of different files and them organize them in a much more accessible format.

I also like to edit my photos.  This allows me to edit photos without easily changing them. With other software I have edited photos and accidentally made the changes permanent. This also allows me to easily compare variations of the same photos with slightly different changes.

I found this software easy to use. I am not a professional photographer or editor but this software allows me to organize and improve the photos I take."

0.5,"Edit: I would like to downgrade this product to two stars. Please read my addendum in the last paragraph below.

I run VMWARE Fusion 2.0 on my latest MacBook Pro (2.8Ghz, 4GB RAM, 512MB Graphics RAM, 7200RPM drive). I run the Mac OS Leopard and the Vista Business edition (SP2) on a BootCamp partition.

This is an excellent virtual machine software that has been expertly programmed. But to run it properly, you need a robust hardware (preferably the latest iMac or Mac Pro) and a LOT of RAM (I would NOT run VMWARE on a machine with fewer than 4GB of RAM). This software is ideal for a hardware with Quad Core processors (most intel chips, including my MacBook Pro, have only a dual core) with 8GB of RAM. The overall performance of this software on my latest MacBook Pro was barely satisfactory and sluggish. Fortunately, the kind of hardware required to run BOTH the Mac OS and Windows CONCURRENTLY with excellent performance will be common (and fairly cheap) in 2-3 years from now. If you must run both OS and run them well, then I recommend you get the best and the latest hardware at your disposal (Quad core + 8GB RAM).

Pros:
1)VMWARE Fusion 2.0 automatically detected my Vista BootCamp partition and there was no additional configuration neccessary. It also gave me the option of transporting the entire Bootcamp into a virtual machine, BUT that would destroy the dual boot (without using VMWARE) capabilities of my MacBook Pro, which I chose not to do. If you are already using BootCamp, the VMWARE Fusion will logically start the BootCamp Windows instance by default. Please note, as long as you do not transport the BootCamp into virtual machine, you can still dual boot your Mac in either OS.

2)I could run the entire Windows Vista as a separte virtual machine (separate OS instance) on OS X Leopard. I can view Vista either in a window or in a full screen size as if I am running only Windows Vista on a Mac.

3)I can choose to view only the active Vista applications running. The Windows applications will look as if the application is running on OS X Leopard. This is one of the coolest feature of VMWARE Fusion. The Vista application still runs on top of Vista so the Vista still must be started (booted) within the VMWARE first.

4)The VMWARE Fusion is very easy to use. But it helps a lot to be computer savy.

Cons:
1)You will need a robust hardware. You simply can't run two hardware hogging OS (yes OS X Leopard is a hardware hog too) simultaneously with a whimpy hardware.

2)Depending on the hardware, you will need to make some minor adjustments. VMWARE Fusion, by default, only allocates 1GB of RAM to Windows, and that is way too little. You should try to allocate 2GB of RAM (assuming you have 4GB) to VMWARE Windows. In my opinion, you should not run VMWARE Fusion, or other competing products, unless you have a minimum of 4GB of RAM.

3)Running two OS simultaneously using VMWARE Fusion may cause your CPU and Memory to operate at or near its maximum capacity. This may cause overheating of your Mac. Futhermore, any application (either in Mac or in Windows) which is a resource hog will be noticeably slowed down and perhaps even be unusable.

Apple (Snow Leopard) and Microsoft (Windows 7) will be releasing far more efficient versions of their OS in the next coming months in 2009. Futhermore, the hardware will also become far more powerful. These two trends will allow users to run BOTH the MAC OS and Windows concurrently, utilizing VMWARE Fusion, with excellent performance in both operating system environments in the coming 2-3 years.

Addendum:

VMWARE has had some very unfortunate and deliberate side effects to my BootCamp Vista partition. It appears most of the troubles are related in VMWARE's deliberate attempt to nullify the utility of BootCamp partition. Unfortunately, the usage of VMWARE has led me to take on the arduous task of reinstalling Windows Vista using Bootcamp for the following reasons:

1)The installation of VMWARE Tools has completely disabled games that use Direct X Windows graphics technology. After you install VMWARE tools, you will no longer be able to play Windows video games when you boot your Mac using Windows. Worst of all, there is no easy way to undo the damage of VMWARE on Vista. I uninstalled all services and programs related to VMWARE on Vista (including VMWARE tools) and that did not resolve the issues.

2)VMWARE has completely disabled Windows Media player capabilities on my Vista. Again, there is no way to undo the damage (I am sure there is a hack but who wants to hack it?).

Now, I would like to recommend against this product. Please use this product ONLY if you do not plan to use Windows for games or as a media player on the BootCamp partition."

-0.5,"I like the idea of this software, a simplified photo ""express"" program that allows one to quickly and easily edit photos.

Unfortunately, the execution of Corel PaintShop Photo Express 2010 misses the mark.  The software is slow to install and seemed to bog down the computer system as soon as it was running.  The program also made itself ""king"" of all photo tasks on my computer, which I did not appreciate.

Like others have mentioned, the program overwrites your files without asking and without warning.  Not a big deal if you don't mind, but as is obvious from the other reviews, most people mind.

0.5,"Back when I did my 2005 taxes, I swore I would never go back to TaxCut.  I had a harrowing experience with the program including software bugs and crashes, inadequate interface, missing schedules, and a nightmare with deduction pro.  To top it all off customer support was virtually non-existant.  When I did get through they were unable to help me.

When I received a free copy of TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal in the mail with 'Free! We want you back"" blazoned on the CD jacket, I was leary but then thought, 'what the heck. It's free, I'll try it.'

PROS:
1. Competent tax programt that has come a long way--now comparable with
TurboTax (in the past this was not the case)
2. Reasonable interface
3. Reasonably priced
4. Federal forms worked smoothly
5. INCREDIBLE customer support via webchat; BETTER than TurboTax
6. Much improved DeductionPro
7. Easy e-file

CONS:
1. I think TurboTax still has the edge...
2 Poor integration with state forms
3. So-so interview for state forms
4. Poor help files for state forms
5. DeductionPro not as easy to use for non-monetary donations/deductions as TurboTax's It'sDeductable
6. Key codes needed for e-filing weren't included in my version.  They were easy to obtain from customer support, but this was an unnecessary annoyance.

So try it, I did and I was pleasantly surprised. I am comparing this to last year's experience with TurboTax, as I was satisfied with TaxCut and went with it.  On the whole, the Federal tax experience is excellent, however, the state tax experience was less smooth.  (See below)

Bear in mind that I do not have an overly difficult return to file.  No major investments and not very complicated itemized deductions.  I did move this year so I had two state forms to fill out and did sell and buy a house.  Other than this, pretty simple and standard.  I completed the taxes on an iMac, so this may be somewhat different than the Windows version.

THE INTERFACE:  For starters, my TurboTax information from last year imported with out a hitch.  The questions were simple and to the point. There are fewer fill-ins per screen than in last year's TaxCut.  My guess is that it took a little longer than last year, but that may have had to do with the increased complexity of my taxes.  One caveat here is that you have to answer the questions carefully, as missing one will result in missing one part of your tax.  In comparison with TurboTax, TaxCut's interview questions are a little less clear.  Double checking and knowing your finances does solve most problems, but care must be taken to make sure you don't miss a schedule or a life event.  On the whole this was easy, but I'd give a slight edge to TurboTax here.

On the whole, the feature sets are similar between programs.  I would have to say, that TurboTax is somewhat slicker.  TurboTax allows you to download some W-2s electronically--I did not see that option in TaxCut.  TurboTax has better integration between help files and the interview and also allows for easier navigation between sections on the tax forms.  But TaxCut is no slouch and was adequate to the task.

DEDUCTION PRO:  This is gobs better than TaxCut 2005.  I like the fact that the program is installed on your computer, making it more responsive than the TurboTax equivalent.  (It'sDeductable!, from TurboTax, is an online program.)  It was easy to input various charities and non-monetary donations.  DeductionPro has a 'calculator' for non-monetary donations, but once you calculate the value you have to manually input it into DeductionPro.  The TurboTax version allows you to calculate the value and then directly inputs it into the spreadsheet--a much smoother operation.  Unlike my past experience with DeductionPro, the deductions were quickly and easily imported into TaxCut.  If you revise your deductions and reimport the file, TaxCut now has a failsafe to prevent you from deducting the same things twice.  Much better than 2005.  If you have a lot of non-monetary deductions, TurboTax would win the competition.  If you have mostly monetary deductions, TaxCut's interface is better and, given that the program runs on your computer, there is no need for passwords and no time lags that can happen on web-based programs.

FINAL AUDIT:  Both programs seem to have reasonable audit features and bring you to the area of the forms where there are questions or problems.  No difference here.

E-FILING: There are 5 free e-files on TaxCut and the process went without a hitch.  Both programs work well in this respect

CUSTOMER SUPPORT/PROBLEMS:  I had to contact customer support 3 times with TaxCut.  Each time, I used their webchat interface.  My longest wait for an customer service rep was 10 minutes.  Each time, the customer service rep was courteous, helpful, and solved my problem.  This is MUCH MUCH BETTER than what occurred in 2005 when customer service was virtually non-existant and unable to help.

Problems included:
1. The need for a Key Code in order to e-file.  Key codes were not included with my program (unclear why).  I needed a keycode for both the federal form and the state forms.  These were supplied by the customer service rep.
2. Inability to remove an inappropriate schedule from a state form.  I was walked through this with a service rep
3. The CD I received did not have DeductionPro bundled with it.  Customer service gave me a download link for the program.  (This may be a glitch in the Apple/OSX version of the program)

Each time help came quickly and easily.  TaxCut gets 5 stars for live 24 hour help.  Last year's TurboTax help was okay, but nothing to write home about...

STATE FORMS:  This is where TaxCut takes a bit of a dive.  Based on my experience with the Federal forms, I bought and downloaded the state forms.  All I needed were the key codes (as noted above) which were absent after the download.  These weren't sent via email, but I knew about this when I requested the codes for the federal forms and received the key codes for the state at the same time.

The state forms are less well integrated with the federal forms than I remember from TurboTax.  I never had to complete two forms with TurboTax.  Suffice it to say, the NJ form was easier than the PA form (which is strange because PA is a flat percentage of your income).  The state forms did not integrate with each other at all.

The PA and NJ forms did import information from the federal forms and W-2s, but did not take the information about my move from the beginning of the TaxCut interview.  I had to input this information into the state forms and actually had to do this separately for each state as the state forms do not integrate with each other.  The same was true for salary collected from one state while my primary residence was in the other.  I had to input redundant information into the program.  It's hard for me to compare this with TurboTax as I had only used TurboTax with a single state before.

The state forms did not have thorough interviews.  Some information had to be typed directly into the forms themselves.  Not specifically a problem, but in the tax software business, the interface is the most important thing.

Finally, the state help files were not as thorough.  Especially for PA, I found myself downloading files from the PA state site in order to review instructions for filling out the tax forms--a major glitch in the TurboTax state forms.

One major problem:  the PA form imported the sale of my home from the federal taxes.  The problem is, sale of a primary residence is not taxable in PA unless some part of the home is used for commercial purposes (or a few other exceptions).  After researching the instructions and downloading PDFs of the PA forms from PA state, I realized that this was the case.  Needless to say, TaxCut calculated a massive underpayment and I was unable to delete scheudule D without consulting customer service.  (As it turns out, I had to delete the schedule D 'worksheet' and then delete the forms.  If you try to delete the forms themselves, nothing happens...)

SUMMARY:  On the whole, I was pleasantly surprised with TaxCut.  Would I use it again?  I suppose I would.  TaxCut was a bit more rough around the edges to use than TurboTax, but beat TurboTax hands down with their customer support.  I would say that these programs are both good ways to do taxes.

On the whole, however, I was pleasantly surprised by TaxCut this year.  Would I have used it if I hadn't received the federal form free? Probably not.  But I will have to think about whether I will stick with TaxCut next year and the program was good enough to get me thinking."
0.5,"Should you upgrade? Well, kind of, I tend always upgrade to the latest from Symantec. For this version I only recommend that you upgrade to ""Norton Anti-virus 2005"", no major differences except for a more sleeker interface and the obvious PC performance drop. Doesn't even include features your getting for free in Windows like a FireWall, which comes free with SP2 for Windows XP. The introduction of technology such as Activation was not smooth, and caused a lot of headaches which only makes the product less embracing than it use to be.

Symantec needs focus on areas such as Speed, Seamless Integration with Windows, obviously it has lost it. My next purchase from Symantec won't be in the retail line, but from Enterprise space. The Corporate Edition of Norton Antivirus, it offers all the tools I want for protecting my PC, yes it cost a lot and its targetted towards the Large Networks, but it is so subtle and easy to use and it does not bog down your PC.

So, should you upgrade?

If recently purchased System Works 2004 or Norton 2004 or any of the Symantec line of products at least wait until your one year subscription is up. Because that's what you buy a utility program for, to keep updated against the latest attacks."
-0.5,"I just read through many of the reviews that claim XP doesn't crash and is rock solid reliable.  I did this after having just experienced my 2nd crash today.  Well, I'm stumped because, while XP performs marvelously for routine, (read: light) usage, I get 9X'ish crashes when I throw some serious processing at it.  The new ""BSOD"", or blue screen of death, is now more of a ""grey hiccup of aggravation"".  After a crash, a little grey box pops up and says ""you have chosen to end a non-responsive program.  Would you like to send an error report to MS?""  I must see this box 2-3 times a day, no kidding.  When it really has a processor brain-freeze, it just completely reboots, w/o warning.  These things are a normal occurrence for me. This is on a clean install, up-to-date system.  I've seen it with other systems as well.  Many of my friends hate XP for this reason, but I've learned to live with it, just as I did with all its predecessors.  Other than that, I really like a lot of the other features, and pretty much all the new toys and MS add-ins are XP-only, so it's worth the upgrade, (if nothing else), to avoid becoming obsolete.  It just gets my goat that many people are constantly touting how stable it is, and I routinely see otherwise.  Stability is OK, but not as reliable as many would have you believe."

-1,"This is probably the WORST version of QuickBooks I've ever used in my life and I've been using QuickBooks since the 90s.  The layout is atrocious, the stock reports are next to useless, and it crashes as if Intuit is a open-source startup!  I haven't experienced such poor quality from Intuit since they ""upgraded"" Quicken 6 (which was the last great version of that program by the way).  If you have an older copy, stick with it.  This is not a great upgrade.

ADDENDUM: It even gets worse! Not only does it behave like a version 1 program, it seems as if the developers have lived in a cave as UI design advanced through the 80s, 90s, and 2000s.  And I don't mean fancy widgets.  When I can't do something as simple as favorite a report THAT I AM LOOKING AT, there's something terribly wrong.  Even from the Memorized Report List, I can't favorite a report.  What I have to do is drill down to the section the report resides and THEN click the heart to favorite it.  Why did they even bother?

By the way this tedium is necessary because I can't simply create a generic Memorized Report that can be used GLOBALLY across companies!  Again, WHY?!?!  The concept of accounting is pretty simple: assets, liabilities, revenue, expense.  The memorized reports group according to those parameters but I can't create ONE memorized report that I can apply GLOBALLY.

As a regular user of Dragon Naturally Speaking for Windows (versions 10 and 12), I was disappointed with these problems.  The Windows version doesn't have them.  Why the problems here?  It doesn't make sense considering the same company is creating both software programs.  After 3 weeks of playing around with this software, I'm going back to using my Windows computer and Dragon Naturally Speaking 12."
1,"Upgrading from Norton 360 version 4.0 to version 5.0 was the easiest antivirus install I have experienced.  It took 10 minutes including the reboot and product activation.  It would have taken about a minute less if I didn't have to retype the monstrous product key three times.  If you are a user of version 4.0, the interface will feel very familiar.  One nice improvement is the performance tab.  You can mouse over icons on a particular date and see what was installed - software, windows updates etc. -what scans were done, what was downloaded and any threats detected.  There is also a safe web icon where you can enter and check out a URL before going there in your browser.

If you are upgrading, I have a word or warning.  After the upgrade your Norton will be all green checks indicating everything is in order.  This was not the case for me.  I ran Live-update just to make sure and it connected and downloaded over 100mb of data and required another reboot.  Another thing to do to improve performance after install is to run Norton Insight.  It increases performance by identifying files that do not need consistent scanning.

Of note, in the May 2011 edition of Maximum PC, Norton ranked 9 of 10 in their antivirus shootout.  It proved very effective in stopping viruses and malware.  It uses SONAR technology which watches program behavior to ID threats and not just virus definitions.  That is why I decided to continue using Norton.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product."
1,"If you have 2009 installed already (which I have) then all this software needs to do is update to 2010 which is a simple process.  I have it installed on a Vista computer and an Atom Netbook with Windows XP and it functions perfectly on both.

An overview of MapPoint is that it is a must for the serious / business users; it has all the features of Streets and Trips plus powerful data mapping, information analysis, and communication tools.

It is very powerful.  You can basically search by street to any location in the USA and Canada plus it also has street level coverage of Mexico.

It is easy to use.  You can type in a street or just click on the map.  You can put in start and end locations and MapPoint will map it all out for you so you can streamline those travel plans.

If you want to see detailed data information on different areas such as age, population, etc. then this program has it.  This is great for business users so you can target certain products to certain areas.  You can also use the maps etc. in your Microsoft Office applications (such as Word, Excel etc.) to create your own specialized documents.

Once you get rolling then you can plug the GPS receiver in your car into your computer and then run MapPoint in the full screen navigation mode to follow that route you already planned earlier.  It even has voice direction.

I really enjoy using this software, it has all the features of a good navigation program plus it is a powerful mapping and information tool.  The functionality is near perfect which is as you would expect from Microsoft.

The 2010 version is a good update and enhances the program to give it even more features and make it even more user friendly."
1,"Have used TurboTax since they (I believe) bought out Parsons Technology's (a competitor) tax software.

I'm working with a small custom bike business and this software has a lot of features that I haven't used yet but it pretty much does everything.

I have been using some other 2014 Sage software for a few months now so I'm already familiar with the interface but it isn't hard to use and their customer support is top notch.  I highly recommend this if you have a small business and need some professional software."
1,"I was a bit intimidated at first by this software suite, but once I installed it and followed the tutorials, I found it highly intuitive to use... and a lot of fun, too."
0.5,"I had been debating whether to get a GPS (like a TomTom) and didn't want to spend that much on a navigator. So I was glad to try this product out. Of course, you have to deal with your own laptop issues in a vehicle when you want to use this - so it's a little more burdensome than a TomTom. But I found it quite useful.

The software installation was nice and simple for me - I have XP. But at home, my GPS was not picking up many satellites. It did eventually find some, but it took a while. And every time I start up the software, it seems to take a few minutes to find the satellites from inside my home. That part was not good because I wanted to make sure I knew how to use the product before going out on the road! But eventually, it would track enough satellites to give me good directions, etc. The audio was loud enough on my laptop, but I think it could stand to be louder. You never know when you're going to drive through a very noisy intersection, etc. And then there are plenty of tools in this software. Calculate the cost of a trip (you can input gas price, etc.), find good restaurant deals on a certain route, etc. I haven't used all the tools much, but I'm sure these are great for the frequent travelers.
Overall, I think for the price, this is a pretty good product."

This new reading program is just as good and I daresay can be used with children even younger than the recommended 3 years of age, since it includes shapes and symbols as well as letters and reading basics.

As others have noted, this program includes 50 individual exercises and innumerable activities. It does indeed encourage literacy even in the preliterate infants and toddlers.

Then these wave of security patch start to roll in.  I only use the PC for watching blu-ray movies and after installing 100+ security patches, the system is so slow that I cannot finish 90 minutes movies without rebooting the operating system.  Microsoft eventually did fix the video resetting problem (one of those 100+ patch fixed it), but OS is pretty much useless for doing what it is design to do.

Now I have to make a decision to add additional memory to satisfy this memory starving OS (I am currently running with 2 GB) or wipe it clean and install Windows XP."
-0.5,"I have been using a home theater PC to run my TV since 1998 when I got my first HDTV but didn't have any high def sources for it.  So I used a TV with a capture card to capture other sources and upscale them for the new TV.  And I've not been without a computer on the TV since.  Once Windows Media Center came out in the early days of Windows XP, I was in heaven.

So for me, I need something like this to play my blu ray content.  I have PlayStation 3 and 4, as well as the Xbox One, that can play DVD's, but I don't like the interfaces, even when using my Logitech Harmony remote with the Xbox One.  I've always preferred actual discs be played in my computer.  More options for me to do things.

I also have a ton of movies and TV shows in MKV format.  I never bothered worrying about playing them on my iPads and such.  I didn't need them THAT portable, I have a TV in the only two rooms I'm likely to want to watch something.  But when I got PowerDVD 13, I found that the media server worked very well for my iPads and even iPod touch and iPhone.  It was great that my son could pull up all the cartoons I have saved on my media server anytime he wanted with his iPad.  I was able to play my 3D blu rays as well without any problems, and my standard DVD's looked very good.  It did everything I wanted.

So I had hopes for the version 14.  But while the basics work fine, such as DVD playback, Blu Ray playback, or even using the free PowerDVD remote on my mobile devices to duplicate a touchpad to control the mouse, the one thing I had come to appreciate, the transcoding for remote devices, totally does not work.

I have the app on my iPad, and the iPad can see my computer in the list, but it won't connect anymore like it did in version 13.  It just errors out and says it can't connect.  Or sometimes it will connect, and all I see is an empty folder.  When I look at the computer that the software is installed on and look at the media it is offering up, I see all my files listed without any issues.  Firewall is turned off, there's nothing blocking any access.  From other computers I can still just map the network drive and play things fine, but from the Power Media Player on my iPad, I get nothing.

Since that was a bonus feature that I ended up enjoying, but not something critical for my base functionality, I'm not losing sleep over it, nor wasting time more than the 20 minutes I already spent trying to resolve it.  I just wrote it off as a feature that clearly doesn't work as well as it used to in the previous version.  I'm guessing part of the issue may be that this full version isn't smart enough to see a previous version and just UPGRADE the existing version, but it installs as a separate program.  That was a pain at the beginning, and I ended up uninstalling all the Version 13 components to help alleviate any conflicts from this poor install routine.  I'm guessing that I may be able to overcome some of my issues if I were to nuke it all off of my computer, and just do a clean install of version 14 now that version 13 doesn't exist anymore, but it's just not worth the hassle.  If they can't write their programs well enough to accommodate existing users who upgrade from one version to the next if they end up with a full version of the newer version, then I figure I will spend my time and money and effort with someone else's solution who does want to make the experience as trouble free as possible.

If you're looking for a way to watch DVD's and blu ray discs on your computer, this will work.  But I'd go with the lowest cost version for what your needs are.  If I had paid for this version, I would've wanted my money back.  As it was free, I'll just leave it alone and just use it to watch discs as needed, if I don't just ditch it altogether and start using the Xbox One for my Blu Ray playback instead..."
0.5,"As an old Dos user of the original personal tax return software published by Parsons, I like this software.  I have also used TurboTax for several years and except for the fact that it costs more, I like it too.  Turbotax used to be able to download Schedule D data from many brokerages, but they discontinued that feature, so I saw no advantage in paying more.  Taxcut never had that feature, but if you have to do Schedule D from scratch in both cases there is no reason to pay more.  Taxcut imports last year's return data from Taxcut or Turbotax and marks it for editing.  It will also import Quicken data, but I don't have high confidence in my own data being correctly assigned to the appropriate tax categories, so I bypassed that step, but I did print out a Quicken Tax Schedule to refer to.  I noticed only one software error and that is when doing a new W4 form for Estimated Payments for 2008, it kept inserting my last year's wages even though I stated I would have no wages in the interview step.  However, this can be manually corrected by opening the whole form and zeroing out the data.  I have always done my own taxes manually until the early 80's when Parson's came out with their tax software.  I'll never go back to the manual method.

Update:
I used the 2010 version for that tax year.  The Federal portion worked very well, but the State had a glitch in the software.  The Georgia State version somehow made an error in handling retirement income.  I made sure there were no more updates planned and then submitted my return.  My computer crashed so I bought a new one and loaded the ""At Home"" software and did an update.  I was surprised to find that I did not owe anything to Georgia.  I found the fault and claimed my refund.  The State agreed and sent it to me.  There must have been an update for the software to be right, but there was no notice given.  Early submissions carry some risk with them."
1,My daughter just got her driver's license and I have been using this to make sure she is using the car responsibly when she by herself. It allows me to see if she goes anywhere she does not tell me about. It also allows me to monitor her speed and braking habits. It gives me peace of mind that she has reached her destination when she forgets to let me know. It also allowed me to help correct a bad habit she was acquiring of idling for long periods. I think it is an amazing tool for parents of new drivers!
1,"The Good:

* Set it and forget it
* Traditional firewall and scanners you expect from a suite and then some
* Innovative features like anti-theft protection, keystroke encryption and wi-fi detector on your browser(tested on IE and Mozilla)
* Provides Mobile security for many PDAs as well

The Bad:

* Anti-Theft protection could've been extended to do much more

The Bottom Line:

A great product from Trend Micro.  Once you install it, you forget that its even there.  It doesn't bug you for every little thing like other suites tend to do.  It provides a powerful protection silently in the background.  Of course you may choose to do scans manually.  It has firewall, virus scan and a tune-up scan.  This is also a great suite for laptops as its easy on the resources and provides Wi-Fi security on the browser's toolbar.  It will let you know if the Wi-Fi you are using secure or not, in addition to whether or not the website you are on safe or not.  The anti-theft lock feature is a mixed bag but is still a good addition to the suite.  In a nutshell, you set up a master password(which if you ever forget, they will email it to you.)  You have the option to lock a folder where supposedly you keep all the private data in.  If your PC/Laptop gets stolen, nobody will be able to access that folder.  All you need to do is go to Trend's website and report your computer stolen.  Once your lost computer goes online, that folder will always remain locked, even if they know the password to the vault file.  My only gripe is:  If its possible to lock one file, why not have the ability to lock the entire computer while you're at it?  However, that minor ding will not stop me from recommending this product to others as I hope I never get to use the benefits of anti-theft features."

Many people do not realize how important it is to make their decisions about life support known to their family, this software makes that process easy. The software does have some hiccups and the constant attempts to get one to upgrade are rather annoying considering this is paid software and not a free trial.

I take comfort in knowing that it doesn't overlook deductions, credits, or expenses. Once I have gone through the interview process (which is ridiculously simple), I know I have touched all the bases.

For example, when you just want to do a quick backup, it has all sorts of calender nonsense, even though it's just a backup.  It won't use your name for the backup, so you end up with backup1, backup2, backup3, etc., with no easy clue as to when it was made and what is in the backup.  It does not have conventional menus to get you where you need to go, you have to fumble around and try to find something that looks like it might be what you want.  But few of the usual options are available.  In other words, the programmers are so convinced that you are stupid and have no idea what you want, that they have made it essentially useless.

There there is the fact that it takes up a whopping 123 mb on your disk, and forces you to load a ""service"" that runs all the time, slowing down and clogging up your machine (and perhaps conflicting with a program you really need).

If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive program that has a lot of advanced features (they claim there are ""hundreds of stunning visual effects"") this would be a program to consider purchasing.  It allows you to import a wide variety of digital media, capture video, and output the videos in a wide range of formats. It also includes a complete disk burning program.

The software can be installed in either 32 or 64-bit!  I'm using it on a 64-bit Windows 7 computer."
1,Have currently put Kaspersky on our family computers and am having good results. Can recommend Kaspersky Anti Virus 2012 over Norton. Both do the job but Kaspersky seems quicker and have not had any virus problems. I rank it as one of the top virus programs. Also have experience with Trend Micro and McAfee. Right now

-1,"I'm a Security Software tech, and wanted an AV that would protect me from Ransomeware?-
I have a Fast Win7 desktop computer, with a 10k rpm Hard Drive, and 60mbps cable internet.

According to independent AVcomparitives review, my old ""Buggy"" ESET IS AV did Not protect me!
I then tried Norton Internet Security ""Premium"", and it's backup files option made it SLOW (even when disabled)!

I gave WSA a 2month try, and Hate it!-
Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus is Cloud based, with No data memory... files on your computer.
This means that ""every"" time I open any program/application..., it has to upload the info..., check it, then download the OK back (big lag time!).
I've tried 3 cloud based AV's, and they were All slow!

I then installed Norton Internet Security ""Standard (get Deluxe if you want it to also protect your other devices (cell...)"", with No backup...
It is Fast, and I disabled their useless Search page.
It has a fast site advisor, and scans downloads..."
-1,"I recently purchased a new PC from Dell, and I bought this software (from them) along with the computer.  Owch, what a mistake, I should have read the reviews here first.

I had pretty low expectations/requirements from this software actually.  Mainly I just wanted to move over my settings, email, and music.  How about 0 for 3!

Firstly, the software can only be used 1 time (owch!).  That is their ridiculous licensing agreement.  Second, you need to install it on both the machine you are moving from, and the machine your are moving to.  Alright, so I'm moving from a windows xp machine to a windows vista machine.  Surely that's got to be the most common configuration these days right?  Surely that's the one thing that would work right?  wrong.  Firstly, the installation crashed on *both* machines.  After downloading updates from the web, re-installing and uninstalling several times it finally seemed to install correctly.

Smooth sailing from there right?  Nope.  First, I tried to do the transfer over ethernet, since I have a home network and that is supposidly supported by this software.  That didn't work at all.  So then I grudgingly tried a transfer over the cable that they provided. The software had a lot of trouble recognizing the cable, but after fiddling with that until it worked, I finally set up a transfer.  Several hours later, my vista box had developed major problems, none of my email or bookmarks or anything had been transfered (only documents) and I was one cheesed off customer.

This software is completely (and I mean COMPLETELY) worthless.  It's a waste of your time, and a waste of your money.  Believe me, the way to go is just to get an external hard drive and drag the files over you want to keep, or do it over your home network if you have one.  You'll save yourself a lot of time and a lot of headaches doing it that way, believe me, I wish I had."

0,"I think this program is very well designed. It was a breeze to install and very easy to use. It has lots of features and functions, such as the ability to scan external drives for threats, and has a really well designed user interface. I really like how it does an automatic update just prior to a full scan. However, it is very annoying that the program asks me to do a system back up every time I run a full system scan. This is highly annoying. You would think that after I click ""no"" 100 times in a row that it would be get the hint and stop asking me. It is truly annoying as I do not want Norton backing up anything. I simply want it to scan and leave me alone. The program always seems to find something to fix and it almost always finds some tracking cookies. It almost seems as if this program is programmed to find things to fix. Maybe the designers of the program want to make the program seem more valuable to the user. After all, the antivirus program is always ""fixing"" something so it MUST be very valuable and useful! I tested this program initially on a freshly installed operating system that has not accessed the internet and this antivirus program magically finds ""30 tracking cookies."" Hmmmm... No matter what, the program ALWAYS finds something to present to the user that it has fixed or alleviated thereby making the program seem endlessly valuable. I can't help but think about how valuable this approach would be when the subscription expires and it's time to pay an annual hefty fee to renew that subscription. After all, every single scan has ""saved"" the user from some sort of mystical threat thereby warranting the purchases of these hefty annual subscriptions. I would not be so suspicious if every single scan didn't reveal some sort of threat that the product has thwarted nor would I have been as suspicious if even a single scan had said ""no threats found."""

** Update Feb 1, 2015: I just got my 100% free copy of H&R Block Deluxe Federal + State 2014. It's for anybody who used TurboTax in 2013 and wants to switch. You just send them an email with your 2013 invoice or product key. Google ""H&R Block Giving Free Tax Software to Disgruntled TurboTax Users"" to see if their offer is still open and the correct email address to use. **

This year TurboTax Deluxe has removed support for Schedules C and D. (You can still fill in the forms in the software and file your return on paper if you want.)

I might give it 2-stars, except I just got their ""We're sorry and we want to make it right"" letter chocked full of weasel-talk.

Instead of being honest about why they removed support for Schedules C and D, they say:

""However, as new online and mobile technologies emerged, our products, and the tax scope and features they included, began to differ, leading to customer confusion. These differences also impeded our ability to introduce new innovations across our entire product line.""

In essence, ""we did this to avoid confusion and help us be more innovative.""

0.5,"Honestly, there are so many people whom have found Microsoft Office to be more of a challenge to own compared to Windows 10. There have been so many people whom have considered to buy Office 365, and sadly, they have wound up spending more money because they would feel a subscription service would be the only way of making sure your computer in on tact with Word, Powerpoint or Excel. But there are some people that would honestly really need just one computer to run Microsoft Office, but that would be fine if it was limited to one computer. Than this would be a better buy. Microsoft Office Home & Business 2016, is geared for lifetime use of 1 PC. But honestly, it really does deliver based on the dollar alone. The software really does run very nicely on a Windows PC, and has no hassles. It works very well on my Windows 10 computer, and all the software needed from Powerpoint and Excel, and especially Word work very well in this software suite. I really found it to be very simple and easy to run. If you really are looking for a good Office suite for your computer, and don't want to be talked into a subscription, than I sincerely recommend you buy this software.

1. The ""protection"" is good for 1 year only & then you get to pay again.
2  You have to put in a credit card number when you install the software.
3. There is a Norton anti-theft icon on your desktop for any would-be thief to see.
4. Any would-be thief that knows a little about computers can override this Norton software and/or wipe the hard drive.

This software does not live up to my expectations.  For a laptop locator, I'd look elsewhere.

0,I've used it several time to route trips.  Compared to an older version it sometimes take strange routes that seem out of the way.

0,"Norton 360 version 2.0 is the latest iteration of Symantec's popular all in one utilities.  It came about as a bundling of the various standalone software such as Norton Antivirus, Norton Utilities, Norton Firewall and Ghost (included in some versions).  The fact that these software were developed separately and then marketed together shows up in the uneven performance across the board.

First, the good.  The Utilities component is outstanding.  The defragmentation feature is worth the price of admission and represents an upgrade over the vanilla variety that windows offers (which in of itself is licensed from symantec I believe). the registry maintenance is another heaven-sent feature.

Then there is the ugly. Some components such as the Antivirus consume an inordinate amount of system resources to cause a noticeable slowdown in system performance.  While the virus protection does work well there are free programs which work just as well, with minimal hit to your computer's speed.

360 2.0 is more user friendly than the prior versions with better integration of the various components.  It is to be recommended for the casual user.  However, expert users will be able to replicate much of its functionality using free utilities that are faster and much efficient."
0.5,"I have used a different program for cards for years and years . . . . but I got a new computer and it would not load, so I decided to give this one a try.

There are lots of cards to choose from.  For the most part its easy to tweak the cards the way you want them, after you get used to using the program.  Honestly, its not super user friendly, but again, once you get used to it, its not a big deal.  You can print them as half-fold, or 4X6.  Note that you will not see the 4X6 option until to actually start to print the card.

Unfortunately, its impossible to search for things.  There is a search feature, but it doesnt work.  For example:  You want to add some balloons from the clip art section.  So you type balloon in the search box.  Absolutely nothing comes-up.  Another example:  You want to search all cards, so you click the search theme icon.  The type in travel.  Absolutely nothing comes-up.  Unless you know exactly where to find what you're looking for.   youll be hard-pressed to find it by using search anywhere in the program.  Also, if youve started working on something. . . . and then you want to go back and check-out something else. . . I don't see a way of getting back to what you were working on unless you save it before you go anywhere else in the program.

Even with these flaws, there is enough to like about this software to make it a well worth while purchase.  Im assuming that I will be able to use it for years to come without having to upgrade anytime soon.

Im running windows 7 and didn't have any issues with installation.  The projects work just fine.  In the end, Im reasonably satisfied with my purchase."
1,"As an IT for a large corporation, I spend a lot of time testing out different vendor's products.  This 19dbi panel antenna is by far the most powerful wifi antenna I have ever used.  I installed the first one at a marina, expecting to need at least three additional repeaters.  After connecting the antenna at the beginning of the docks I was able to get signal all the way to the end of the docks, (about 1 mile), with houseboats completely obscuring any line of sight.  I had five bars almost the entire way to the end of the dock.  When I reached the furthest point from the antenna, I had one bar of signal.  I kept a persistent ping going the entire time, and I did not get a single timeout, even when reduced to one bar.  I tested my Iphone as well and received similar results.  I have now purchased quite a few more of these antennas.  These are definitely a goldmine for the wifi world.  It is a relief to finally find an antenna that lives up to its expectations so that I don't have end users always complaining to me about poor signal strength.  I will be installing these at several lodging establishments and rv parks over the next few months, so I will post again with the results of those scenarios."
-1,"Before you buy this, you should be aware that Intuit charges $15 for each e-file, Federal or state.  There's no free e-filing with Turbo Tax, period.  Seriously, I think $15 is a lot to pay for e-filing.  There are websites that give you completely free e-filing; my favorite is TaxAct (at taxactonline dot com).  With TaxAct, you get the complete Federal plus state package for $7.95, which includes e-filing.  Or you can use their standard package to prepare Federal and e-file for free, with *NO* income restriction!

I don't work for any of these companies, nor any tax-related company, nor any such entity.  I just don't think it's right for Intuit to charge customers such a ridiculously high fee for e-filing, whereas people can e-file for free elsewhere.  BTW, if you use Turbo Tax to prepare your return, you'll have to use Intuit's e-filing service if you want to e-file; you can't just take your file to another website and expect that website to do it for you.  I used TaxAct in the past and they are very dependable.  You can find reviews of TaxAct products in major magazines and on major websites.

Good luck."

1,"Do NOT believe all the knee-jerk garbage you're hearing about Vista, as 90% of it is being pulled out of thin air by people who obviously never even tried it.  Linux and Apple trolls scour the internet for chances to add negative reviews to an operating system they'v never even tried.

Then there are the XP hypocrites who have been using XP for so long that they fear anything new.

Hypocrytes you say?  Yup.  This same negative ""new Windows sucks"" propaganda wave happened when Windows 2000 was released in 1999 (nobody wanted ""NT"") and again when XP was released in 2002 (incompatibility problems, verybody absolutely HATED that ""Made by PlaySkool"" interface). Everybody hated each of them until the next version of Windows came along. Then, suddenly, they LOVED the older version and tried to cling to it. Not only pathetic, but now very predictable.  Vista is just the latest victim.

I have absolutely no love affair with Microsoft, trust me.  But it's time for an actual professional with a masters in programming and operating systems to set a few things straight.

Fact: Windows Vista was in development a whole year before Windows XP was even released. Microsoft had been working feverishly on this OS for 6 years at the time of its release. Little id you know that nearly EVERY Microsoft product that comes out is extensively tested by a public usability testing program that is totally seperate from their beta testing program. Microsoft doesn't let anything out the door until all the usability testers (the general public that come to visit the Microsoft facility in Redmond, Wa) say they like it. Vista was OK'd by both internal and external beta testers in addition to the usability test program, or it never would have been released. I have personally done usability testing at Microsoft 17 times now (I like to get my 2 cents in), and I know how this process works. Microsoft releases software BY CONSENSUS, and Vista is what the people themselves ASKED FOR.

Fact: For its entire life, the virus magnet that is known as Windows XP has been solely responsible for the onslaught of spyware, malware and waves of viruses. Not Mac. Not Linux. Not DOS. Not Unix. It was Windows XP. Prior to XP, Windows would see a problem virus come down the pike once in a while.  Then XP came along, and we've been swimming in viruses and Malware ever since.  Even loaded with antispy and antivirus software, WinXP STILL gets infested and slows to a blue-screening crawl. As you read this on your XP box, I guarentee that you have spyware on your system. Run a scan and see for yourself.  If you're just running Windows Defender, I guarentee you're LOADED with it and don't even know it - get better software immediately.

Fact: Though complaints about Vista's UAC are many, the Internet is not filled with Vista users begging to be saved from viruses and spyware they can't recover from. Those poor souls are pretty much all XP users.  The Vista users complaing of any viruses and spyware are the ones who turned UAC off or clicked right past the UAC warning prompts without evn reading them.

Fact: OF COURSE Vista is going to be slightly slower than XP on the same machine - just like Windows XP was slower than Windows 2000, which was much slower than Windows NT4, etc. etc. This is the natural way things are SUPPOSED TO BE AS HARDWARE GETS FASTER AND FASTER. C'mon, what do you honestly expect? New operating systems are about new features, not ""running faster"" on the same hardware (anybody that knows anything about operating systems knows that new versions are NEVER faster than the previous version, no matter what operating system it is - just take a look at any Linux distro or new version of any Mac OS). It's up to HARDWARE to make things run faster, not the OS. Your system is not fast enough to run Vista? THEN GET FASTER HARDWARE LIKE YOU HAD TO DO FOR XP. Has everyone forgotten that today's hardware is anywhere from 4-10 times faster than than the hardware that was available when XP was first released? And that XP absolutely crawled on our systems when it first came out and that we all complained about it?  And that Vista runs at virtually the same speed as XP once booted up - only with tons of new features? And that soon you will need a new OS to even be able to operate the dual quads already on the market and the dual octo-core systems right arounnd the corner? C'mon, people, get a grip and get kick that common sense glad into gear.

Fact: Since SP1 came out, Vista runs GREAT. I can run any Win32 program I want in Vista that I install, and as of SP1.  I might even be able to run old 16 bit apps now, haven't tried that yet.  Thanks to the freeware release of VDMSound, I am running old DOS games under Vista with full sound.  I repeat - DOS games.  Some of the few remaining software products currently being described as ""Non-Vista compatible"" can be made to work under Vista if you do a little reading and tweaking.

Fact:  Before SP1 came out for XP, XP ran like crap and had tons of compatibility problems.  Everybody hated it, even the way it looks.  Bet you forgot that.

Fact: Turn UAC (User Access Control) off if you want Vista to behave like XP and not prompt you for confirmations. It's as easy as un-checking a checkbox in Control Panel (User Accounts). Note: This will drop Vista security down to the same ""virus magnet/pants down"" level as Windows XP, however, so you decide.  The nice part is that you CAN decide.

Fact: Are you a gamer? Then you already know that Direct3D (DirectX) 10 is Vista-only. All you XP gamers can sit in your own DX9 drool if you want to. Meanwhile, we Vista users are walking around in DX10 games that look like movies. You oughtta see Crysis with dual nVidias running SLI.

Fact: Think you don't like Vista? Waiting for Windows 7 to come out in Q1 of 2010 (at the earliest without any of Microsoft's now legendary and predictable postponements)? You might be interested in knowing that Windows 7 is merely a re-packaging of Windows Vista - just like Windows XP was a re-packaging of Windows 2000 because 2000 didn't sell well (see for yourself at the command prompt - type ""ver"" and take note that Windows 2000 is Windows version 5.0 and Windows XP is version 5.1). Windows Vista is version 6.0. Dig up all the screen shots of Windows 7 you can find on the internet - take note that the title is ""Windows 7"" but the version number is 6.1.  In other words, STILL VISTA. So get used to Vista. Better yet, GET Vista, or you'll eventually be two Windows versions behind when 7 comes out - which won't be until 2010 (at the earliest), and then that version of Vista will be around for 5 years until the next version.

Vista's here to stay, folks. You have a choice of slipping into even more obsolescence with XP (which is just Windows 2000 with lipstick, a 9 year old product) or you can move forward with Vista and Win7.

For me personally, Vista has been spoiling me rotten since SP1 came out. Every time I get up from my Vista machines and sit down on my XP machines, it feels like I'm sitting down on a machine in ""Safe Mode"". Vista makes XP feel old, limited, cumbersome and inadequate. The search functions of Vista alone remove all need for clicking through layers of start menus, even often allowing me to not have to touch the mouse - this alone makes XP feel like an antique. I won't even get into how cool Desktop Search is, SuperFetch, ReadyBoost, or the other many new features that make Vista MUCH faster than XP in many respects.  Read that last sentence again, and then look those things up.  You may commence drolling on your poor ol' outdated XP box's keyboard.

BTW: No, I do not work for Microsoft, and I have been a huge Linux fan since 1997 (SUSE Linux, to be exact, version 11 is fantastic).  I ignore the fact that Linux always takes much longer for apps to load up (and runs clunkier in general) and that both KDE and Gnome always seems to look/work a lot like the latest version of Windows."

0,"Pointing out Word's faults is like pointing out the pyramids are crumbling--it may be true, but they're still going to be there. Still, Word's Master Document ""feature"" is still the surest way to document corruption. And you'd better track down the internet page that gives detailed instructions on the convoluted way you need to set up heading numbering if you want to keep your Word documents from corrupting.
And so on. I doubt anyone cares. Word is a fact of life, no matter if it's constantly falling to bits. The new version's XML support does give you a new path to recovering a corrupted document: saving to XML and then converting that file back to Word format has saved me some time on a couple of occasions.
We use Word because we have to. On those occasions when I don't have to, I use WordPerfect, because I like to actually produce things, not spend my time dealing with software problems."
0.5,"Pretty decent security, has more features than I hope I ever need.

I hate popups, I don't want my security software to come with them."
1,Easier to use this year by making access to current tax file much easier than last year.  Like the immediate patch/upgrade check on login. Used TTax since it came out of a garage based business in my neighborhood.
1,After 15 years with Turbotax Deluxe I bought H&R Block Deluxe for $40 rather than paying about $90 for Turbotax Premier since I have stock sales every year and could no longer use Turbotax Deluxe and file electronically.  The Mac disc loaded fast and it transferred my 2013 Turbotax return data without an error. It took a while to get used to the H&R Block data entry format but once I understood it my data entry went well. I can highly recommend this program as long as you are wiling to spend some time getting used to it if you have been a Turbotax user for many years as was my case.

This library of forms and books is comprehensive and can save you a bundle.  After installing and using it for a few weeks here are the pros and cons that I have come up with:

PROS:
- Simple and straightforward installation
- Easy to use
- Extensive collection of forms
- While I haven't had the time to read it all, the Nolo business books is a great point of reference

CONS:
- fill-in process is required.  IMO it would be much easier to input the information directly into the document.
- no index of documents
- could not find any way to export information to other file formats.

Overall, this collection of forms and books presents a great value that can save you money on your first use, and I'd highly recommend it for other small business owners."

As far as I could tell, at most one core is used by Dragon Dictate, though.

The attached video shows the speed of recognition after voice training by reading the phrases in just the first and simplest voice training scheme.  I read some paragraphs from an advanced equine anatomy text and everything was typed perfectly.  I was truly amazed, not just in comparison with Apple and Google internet-based recognition (which do not involve training) - but in comparison to the last time I evaluated speech recognition using a trained product, several years ago.

The pluses for me include:

1.  A profile is created for each user-microphone combination.  This profile can then be voice-trained by reading scripts to improve accuracy.  Five script scenarios are included, and all five can be done if one wants to really tune things.  I found amazing results after doing just one script.

2.  Individual words can be added and trained, so that names and technical terms will be recognized accurately.  This is easily done via the Vocabulary Editor.

3.  I can speak really quickly and the result is still accurate

4.  Dictation can be into pretty much any application.

5.  Voice commands can be used to control apps, but I have little personal interest in that.  It would be extremely helpful for someone with limited eyesight, coordination, or other physical limitations.

6.  A variety of microphones, including smartphones, can be used for dictation.  Sound files from phones and voice recorders can be transcribed.  A corded USB microphone is included in the box.

7. Efficient voice selection and correction of text

The negatives for me include:

a.  Transcription of a sound file (from a voice recording) can only proceed if a profile (trained voice/microphone pair) is loaded.  Dictate will ONLY load a profile if the corresponding microphone is connected.  Tech support says this is as-designed.  But, it is incredibly stupid when the microphone is neither needed nor used during a transcription process.  The effect is that if you have a sound file containing someone else's voice, and they've trained a profile with a microphone that you do not have, you cannot transcribe the file.

b.  Special vocabulary is saved per-profile, so you have to re-enter all special words (and then re-train) for each microphone that you might use.

c.  The user interface seems really illogical.  I've attached an image to the product at the top of the page showing that there is a red 'Stop' octagon when the microphone is off.  Clicking it does not stop dictation ... it STARTS it.... turning the symbol to a green circle.  The green then means 'go' ... speak and Dragon Dictate will transcribe or respond to commands.  Clicking the green circle restores the red stop sign.  This seems backwards to me, but that's just me:  I would think that clicking the stop icon would STOP recording and clicking the green circle would START it.  If thinking of status lights, most recorders have a red light when they are recording / broadcasting and no light when inactive.  I can't get my head around what Nuance was thinking here.

d.  A variety of actions in the tutorial would not function, particularly spelling mode.

e.  It is challenging to type words that are also Dragon commands.  For example, whether I pause before and after ""new line"" or say it all together within a sentence, the words are never types ... instead a line break is always created.  I can fake it by pausing on either side of ""new"" and then either side of ""line"", but the instructions say that this is unnecessary.  Dracton Dictate has so many built-in commands, that you never know which ones will be obeyed versus typed, so you need to watch your output as you speak until getting used to it.  Personally, I'd like the ability to create a profile in which I disable all commands I never intend to use.

Bottom line:

Useful?  Depends on your typing skills vs verbal skills.  I can type extremely quickly and (usually) accurately and compose best while typing.  Others I know, while reasonable typists, think better when voicing their thoughts aloud, and one friend is particularly interested in Dragon Dictate to get some rough drafts onto paper because of her vocal process.  For those who are slow or poor typists, or who have some physical limitation, I think Dragon Dictate is an excellent value.  For those on Mountain Lion, which includes free internet-based dictation from Apple, the choice will be more personal.  The Apple dictation requires a live internet connection and is not voice-trained, and hence is less accurate; it also does not support voice correction or voice command.  There are audiences for the free Mountain Lion feature as well as for the more powerful Dragon product - I'd suggest first trying the free Mountain Lion feature and if it satisfies your needs, great; if not, take a look at Dragon Dictate 3.

UPDATE 11/30/12:  I would take a star off this review based on the absolutely horrible Nuance customer support.  I've never encountered a more useless system - slow web response,  keeps invalidating my support account, preventing access followed by inability to re-activate the account with the logged cases...and staff which give stock responses that do not address the question asked.  Terrible customer experience leaving me feeling pretty negative about Nuance as a company.

Latest tech support response (unbelievable to me):  Asking them why the built-in microphone on Apple's LED Cinema Displays is not recognized by Dragon Dictate, this is the response:  ""Dragon Dictate requires a mic that has a type that is USB. Go to System Preferences > sound > input. What is the ""Apple LED Cinema Display"" connection ""type?"". If it is not USB, What type is it?""  In other words:  they did not even test Apple's hardware for a Mac product."
1,"I'm not necessarily an artist, but I enjoy playing around with graphic design programs.  I find the adobe world a little daunting, and by contrast sketchbook was pretty simple and easy to get used to.

The software itself is fast and uncluttered.  There are a few useful tools that work well and are easy to jump into.  No program can exactly mimic drawing on paper, but this program comes close and is very immersive.  The pencil is definitely my favorite feature.

I'd definitely recommend Sketchbook for a beginner, and it seems powerful enough for an expert as well."
0.5,"My previous version of QB was 2007. The 2011 version presents some nice improvements. The interface is more usable, but still familiar. There are more charts and graphs available. The addition of ""classes"" allows a user with multiple locations or services (under one entity) to track them independently. I see lots of little conveniences added here and there. This version is a great first edition, but as an upgrade, I am not sure it is worth the expense. I would wait for a couple more years if you are only upgrading."
0.5,"I've used older WinZip programs in the past when I had a job which required the transfer of great quantities of data and I don't recall ever having a problem with it.  Today though, I have been using WinRar program to compress my files and it always did what I needed.  I've since started using WinZip 14 and it does everything I need it to do as well.  It was easy to install, the layout of the program which you see on the screen is easy to understand, and it compresses everything I've needed it too ranging from home audio and video recordings to loads of photographs.  I no longer have to compress huge amounts of scientific data, but if I did I would expect this program to do the job quite well.

I will admit that I have yet to try every aspect of this program, so until I do so I will rate it at 4 stars until I deem it necessary to change the original rating."

Or at least the features that I use on a regular basis never seem to change.  However, I'm sure that SOMETHING changes...  Like when its direction pointing circled-car icon changed to an arrow.  That was a BIG improvement.

I LOVE this program and the way it operates!  However, it appears that Microsoft really isn't interested in investing much money in its design.  So every 1.5 years, they will make some ""token"" changes in order to get its loyal users to buy a new version. With Google Mapping is becoming so popular, the program is probably not long for this world......"

Installation and updates are so easy a caveman could do it. Occasionally for no apparent reason my browsers get blocked by the firewall (verified by turning off firewall and the block is gone). What seems to be a fix is to turn the firewall off, open a browser, then turn the firewall back on. After a few minutes all the browsers are working again. This may be after a browser update that makes NIS think it's a new program. Regardless, it ain't a show stopper."
-0.5,"I'm familiar with earlier version of Roxio Toast so was hoping this newest version would be something special. It's not. At least, not on my Mac running OS 10.6.8 which is supposed to be supported. Almost any requested action is sure to start the spinning beachball of eternal waiting, even with no other programs running.

Although Roxio is quick to suggest you can use this to copy DVDs and Blu-Rays, the print is considerably smaller that tells you that it won't work on protected disks whether you own them or not. However, after ripping a DVD with another program, you can use Toast to burn it to disk...of course, you can also do that in the Mac OS. But with Toast, you can compress large video files to fit more on a disk. The problem? The compression engine doesn't work all that well. I tried converting a video file to MKV format and the result was a file twice as big as my other compression program makes, but only about half the visual quality (it was basically unwatchable).

I tried capturing web video - a new feature - and it flat out didn't work for me. Toast prompts you to start playing a video in your browser, and it will appear in Toast's capture window if it's compatible. I couldn't find anything compatible (like, oh, Youtube). Again, maybe this is a problem with using an older OS - but if that's the case, Roxio should change its recommended specs.

I assume that Toast 12 can still be used to burn basic archival disks of data, but for this price it should do a lot more - or at least do it a lot better.  There are a lot of inexpensive programs out there which will do one or more of the functions Toast offers, and do it better. Toast is an ""all in one"" product for those people who don't want to sift through the other offerings, but what they gain in convenience they'll lose in actual usability. Personally, I'll be going back to my earlier version of Toast which works more smoothly."
0,"Let's start with the good news:
For better or worse, Word, Excel and PowerPoint  have become the de facto standards for word processing , spreadsheet  and presentation tasks, respectively. Anybody who was in the workplace just before the start of the 21st century when organizations --even internally-- were struggling to generate content in  both Word and WordPerfect will appreciate why this this isn't necessarily a bad thing (and I say this even while giving permission to rail against Microsoft's dominance of the productivity applications market...more on this later!).

The applications can be addressed quickly  (I'm not a user of OneNote organizer/collaboration tool, so this review won't address  it all).
If you've been using any version of these applications since Office 2007, you are already familiar with the ribbon interface (and it's often overlooked companion feature, the quick access toolbar).  You will be on familiar ground with these applications. In fact, it's such familiar ground, I can't think if a compelling reason to upgrade from any version since Office 2007. The enhancements are all refinements (including a Clippy-less, but still Clippy-inspired query/assistant  field that invites you to ""Tell me what you're trying to do"".  I spend a lot of time in Word trying to undomits forced style changes that appear at the worst possible times! Excel  has some additional chart types. PowerPoint also has new charts, as well as screen recording tool (that PowerPoint 2013 users already had available as an update).

If you are running a current installation of an earlier version of Office, any customization you have done to the quick access toolbar will be imported into its 2016 counterpart.

Why three stars?

-In addition to entering the key code, you *must* login (or establish) a Microsoft user account; I bristle against this since I already purchased the key.

-Using the KeyCard version requires you to be online in order to install the software. This not a case where you download the full executable and then install it: the install is indicated to you only as a progress bar. Also: the license is for a single device only.

-If you need calendaring, email or database processes: they are not present in this version. While this is clearly labeled, this is still a pricey package. Even though it's much more affordable than the Professional version, students should check with their instution on the possibility of deeply (and I mean real deeply...like on the order of 90% or more depending on your institutional licensing arrangement, which are often under-publicized). When you know these arrangements are available, it's painful paying full sticker for a lesser version.  If the steep price is too much, take a look at open source and no cost options (such as LibreOffice, which will create, edit and save Office products in their native file formats, and probably work well for all but the most advanced functions).

Applications work great, but Microsoft's overall approach towards this has my spidey sense tingling."
1,Habla YES!
1,"I will tell you right now what makes this piece of software one of a kind.

Most (other) language learning software is based on templates. They have a single template for your learning needs and they just fill the blanks for each different language. That's just like having a single universal template on how to ""drive"" and then hoping to fill the blanks for a car, a bike, a truck and a tank, no matter how different they actually are.

Fluenz is different. Even though they probably follow similar scenarios for the different languages, it's downright obvious that each lesson was created from scratch according to the language's specific traits and difficulties.

All the explanations you'll find in Fluenz French are there for a reason, and that reason belongs to the specific language you are learning. What may need 10 minutes of explanation in one language, may take no time in another.

Something else Fluenz gets right is that they teach you how to say ideas in the new language, not only words and grammar, but whole ideas. That's what you need for fluency. I've been learning languages for quite a while, English is not even my native language, and you can trust me when I tell you that having to construct phrases in your head putting grammar rules and words together every time you speak will take you nowhere.

Finally, perhaps irrelevant at first sight but unmistakably important a few hours later: it has the right ambiance. It has nice background music, i.e. it doesn't feel mechanic or boring.

I'm not an easy guy to please with this kind of software but so far I've done about one third of the program and I'm extremely happy with it."
0,"As a product that claims to provide powerful accounting and reporting functionality that is even more simplified in the newest version, I would have expected more.  If setting up a company from scratch, the software behaved fairly well and the setup was fairly straightforward.  However, in doing a conversion the upgrade path was troublesome.  The user interface was well placed and organized, but wasn't advanced compared to other accounting software I have used.  There were many features that I would consider premium, unless of course, you are taking into account their service and support pricing road map.

It really appears that Sage is trying to get you to buy into more of their services.  You could be easily looking at additional investments for payroll services and future upgrades that offer little benefit.  For small startups, Sage 50 Premium could be an excellent buy, although I would be concerned about future support and services.  For businesses on other established systems or those are growing quickly, I would really weigh the options and look at a more versatile package.  In my prior work in accounting systems, you really want to look at how much customizations you might need.  Sage 50 Premium is actually pretty good if you go with all of the canned functions.  However, if you require customizations you might be digging a ditch that you cannot climb out of cheaply."
0.5,"The cloud player could be better.  But my biggest complaint is that Amazon needs to make playing music as ubiquitous as it makes reading books on the Kindle app.  In fact, the one place I don't really need an app is on my PC (since I can just use the web version).  I'd sure like to have a Windows Phone App and Windows 8.1 App though.  And I'll bet there are a lot of people out there who would like an iPhone app or Google Phone app too.

-1,"I really do hate giving a product only one star but this product has earned it.
I am puzzled because Corel has most of the facilities to produce a user friendly photo editing program at low cost.
After all, they have all of the routines coded already. In addition, since they bought out Ulead, they now have two different approaches to photo editing.

While I realize that they were targeting the casual photographer, that can be done with existing routines from their other products. I use Automatic Photo Correction all of the time from their Ulead Photoimpact product that does cost three times as much as this one does but it has so many more capabilities that cause it to cost that much more. But its basic functions could have been put into this product and been even easier to use than this one is with more capabilities and still meet their cost goals.

Their automatic photo correction isn't much better than Windows Picture Gallery and that is a free component of Windows.
The only major capabilities missing from Picture Gallery are the ability to change the picture size and to rotate the picture.
But those features are already functional in Photoimpact as well as several other Corel products.

The overall feeling I got using this product is the same I got using ACDSEE's editor only clumsier. The suggested retail price of ACDSEE is the same as for Photo Express but ACDSEE has so many more features they are not in the same league. Yet their target customer is the same as Corel's is, the casual photographer maintaining their home scrapbooks.

All I can say is that simple doesn't have to mean simplistic and even casual photo editors are going to want to do a few fancy things like add fancy text or stylize some of their photos."

Once again, I was extremely pleased with the quality of this antivirus software product. Not only was the installation a breeze, I was delighted to see that no ""bloat-ware"" or undesirable software was installed at the same time as the main antivirus program.

Furthermore, my computer seems to run just as quickly as it did before installation, which is an important criterion in selecting a ""total protection"" anti-virus program."

I also show some tricks I've learned over the last couple of weeks of using the program, for example use Tab key to make all palettes disappear so you have the full screen to draw on, how to use any brush for an auto painting and not just the one's Painter wants you to see!

I show things none of the the other video's I've seen so far show so I think it's worth a watch ;)

Haven't had this much fun with a software program for a long time so check out the video to see just a fraction of the stuff I've come up with using this program for the last couple of weeks. I had always heard of this program but never actually tried it till now and don't know why I waited so long since there is so much you can do if you let your creativity take control!

The main idea you need to understand to get the most out of this software is what clone color is and how it's related to the clone brushes. Basically, if you have clone color from source image turned on whatever brush you use to paint on the canvas will pick up the colors underneath. Depending on the brush you use you'll see a totally different result. You can use the soft cloner brush to brink back more detail from the underlying photo if you don't like what you see. This can all be automated via the auto-painting wizard but only let's you do it for a couple of brushes. If you want to use any other brushes like the particle brushes, as I show in my video, you need to do it manually and my video shows how. Of course you don't have to start with a picture and start from scratch and I show a picture at the end of my video showing the results of some clouds and sun I painted from scratch but didn't have time in video to show.

I also used the trial version of full version of Painter 2015 and what I found is that you can do almost everything the full version can but you'll never have the power of the full version because the most powerful feature of the full version is not only that you get way more brushes to start with but you can create and save your own brushes! Also, you can import brushes and work spaces with color palettes that other artists using the program use. But even essentials comes with over 100 brushes so it will keep you busy for quite a while if you end up enjoying it as much as I have.

Oh yeah at the end of my video I show the before and after pictures of some of the images I created using this program.
Also, I put a screenshot of the brushes and interface of the older Painter Essentials 4 which I think was actually better since they actually used drawings of all the different brushes instead of just a scribble of what the output of the brush is going to be. Also, the help was way better in version 4 and it even includes some video's that showed how to use all different parts of the program which was also included in the 130 page manual it came with. It also came with some sample images which you could play around with and I used one in my video. The new version comes with a 25 page manual which isn't very helpful at all and basically tells you to search YouTube which is the worst advice since there's hundreds of Painter video's which a person new to the program won't know where to start!
Almost took off a star for that but the program is so fun and must faster, actually uses all 12 cores on my PC, and stable it'd be more like 1/2 star."
0.5,"The product itself is quite good, in depth fixes, easy auto features.  The company REALLY wants you  to add time to your subscription and the pop ups do become annoying.  Especially since I have 1 1/2 years left to go on mine still.  The upgrades are included in your subscription so you do NOT need to add time to get them."
0.5,"Corel Painter Essentials 4 is user friendly program that allows you to transform digital photos into paintings, or just to plain sketch and paint away on a blank canvas.  The program offers beginners video tutorials to introduce the basic tools and shortcuts.

Photo painting transforms a digital photograph into a painting. You just import a photo and click on the auto-paint button, which transfers the image into any specified medium (oil painting, water-color, chalk drawing, etc.)

The interface is very well organized, with easy toolbars and many keyboard shortcuts. The Painter's tools allow image editing operations such as cropping and cloning, as well as adding touches like smearing brush strokes and bringing some photographic detail back into a painting.  You can manually trace and paint the image or use the auto-paint feature.

A graphics tablet is recommended to get the most out of Painter. Also, some of the more advanced functions are harder to understand, but it's still a very user friendly program overall."
1,I have been using TurboTax for several years.

iMovie Lite 1.0 (iMovie 08) is fine to edit a 3 minute video to share on youtube, but it lacks features that are needed for longer projects or if you want to make a DVD of your movie.

iMovie Lite 1.0 (iMovie 08) lacks a true timeline, Nor does iMovie Lite 1.0 (iMovie 08) let you add DVD chapter markers to specific spots in a movie, such as the beginning of each major scene (each day in your vacation, for example).

I feel bad for people who purchase iMovie 08 but have never used 06. They may never know how good Apple can be at designing entry level video software.

But what if you want those missing capabilities? Apple has a great video-editing program for you: it's called iMovie HD (iMovie 06).

I am confident that Apple will eventually correct this mistake. (I understand that Apple has made iMovie 06 a free download for owners of iMovie 08!) I believe that the best course of action would be for Apple to continue upgrading iMovie 06 (iMovie HD) with full support for iDVD and DVD burning. Rename iMovie 08 (iVideo?) for small, quick little videos or slideshows for absolute beginners that don't want to burn a DVD."

I have never had a problem installing this software for 8 years now, and it has always performed reliably, preparing flawless tax returns, and ensuring quick and easy refunds.

I've used the relevant versions to report Schedule C self-employment income (the program quickly and easily calculates the self-employment tax, ensures you get social security credit for your self employment, and gives you next year's estimated tax payments) as well as investment income.  The feature to download 1099-DIV and 1099-INT statements from your investments accounts is priceless, as is its ability to calculate your short and long-term capital gains.  Schedule D is a scary form, I cannot imagine doing it myself.  Yet I breeze through it year after year with the help of TurboTax and the automatic imports from my brokerage accounts.

0,"Roxio's 'Crunch' video conversion software does exactly what the product box claims it can do - ""helps you easily convert your DVD's, movies, and TV shows for use with Apple TV, iPod, and iPhone.""  What is somewhat misleading though is that if you carefully examine the fine print on the box you will learn that Crunch does not convert copy protected or encrypted DVDs.  This is totally to be expected and personally I have no problem with such a restriction, but based on several user reviews posted here it seems that many were mislead on this point and it should be noted more clearly that this product is not an 'out of the box' solution to converting commercial DVDs for view on your iPod devices.

That being said, if you are in need of a software solution to convert a myriad of video formats (e.g. - AVI, DV, QuickTime, Mpeg 1-4, DivX, Xvid, etc.) for use and view on your iPod/iPhone/AppleTV devices, Roxio's Crunch is an elegant and streamlined solution to do just that.  Installation is a cinch and the program's interface is simple and intuitive for anyone with a better-then-average grasp of Windows or Mac UI's.

My main gripe though is that the outputting process is a bit slower then I would've liked.  Granted, my computer isn't exactly a speed-demon but she's no slouch either.  If the output rate could be improved in future updates I'd definitely bump my rating up to 4 stars."

1,"This program is still the best program on the market for amateurs and other levels of the everyday user and maybe even a few `pro-sumers' like me. If you're a parent and your goal is to just very simply create some nice looking home movies to burn on DVD and distribute to other family members or even upload directly to Youtube (which is a very nice feature), then Ulead Video Studio is looking like the best program out there for doing so. It's also, by far, the easiest to use and understand while not forfeiting presentation quality and features doing so. The learning curve on this is very fast and dedicating a mere ten minutes to the manual will yield pretty impressive results.

Some folks might think that you'll have to invest thousands of dollars on a new Mac so you can have a new version of iLife and do all this without having an intimate knowledge of video editing or processing, but this really is a much better and a much cheaper alternative. While buying a Mac is always a cool prospect, you may not have to do that just yet.

The only drawback I could find was in using the built-in `Movie Wizard' which is a bit restrictive, even though it's `drag and drop'. Creating movies this way, renders your footage faster and gives you a much grainer, or lower resolution end result. If you can avoid using this feature, I would, as having the ability to fully control the output settings is an absolute must."

I've done Pimsleur in Spanish and Italian and a little bit of German, but this is the first time I've tried Rosetta Stone. It beats the Pimsleur aural method hands down. Pimsleur comes at you on a one-way street. They repeat phrases over and over again and you try to repeat them back. You can't even see the words you're trying to say. You just listen and repeat. If you don't have a fantastic ear for language, you're going to have no idea whether you're even coming close to repeating the original.

That being said, this is much more expensive than one Pimsleur set. If you can afford it, then go with Rosetta Stone; if not, then try the Pimsleur. In fact, before you buy Pimsleur, see if it's available in your local library. Take it out and try it before you plunk down the money for it. Personally, the visual cues, variable targets and pacing, and voice recognition for speech perfection in Rosetta Stone make it worth the extra money for me.

I took one semester of German in college, 34 years ago. That gave me a little familiarity with the language structure. That was then reinforced by 15 years of working for or being associated with German-owned companies, and the 30 or more trips to Germany I've made over the years. I picked up some of the language, but it was a pidgin version of German, interspersed with a lot of English words and helped a lot by the very courteous way in which my German colleagues helped me get a little closer to saying things the right way.

So I had some background. But when I sat down with the Rosetta Stone/German package, it was the first time I felt immersed in or surrounded by verbal cues, visual cues, and instantaneous translation. This really worked for me. I don't learn that well by just listening.

I have to admit I also had a lot of fun with this. There was an interactivity and pacing that was much more engaging than either Pimsleur recordings or even classroom language learning. I also liked that it recorded my progress within my goal set. I highly recommend this product."
0.5,"I'm an old time Corel user.  There was a point in time I could do just about everything with what the Corel product line offered.  It helped my cureer, but that was a long time ago.  I have to admit, when I see the name Corel attached to Pinnacle and needing a video editing program I decided on version 19 Ultimate.

Well, this isn't the easy simple to use version of Corel I once knew, it is much more of a challenge.  A challenge worth spending time on.  I've had this program for about a month and I have managed to put together a few short videos and I am happy with how they turned out.  I have much more to learn, and this program, I hope will become easier to use with time.

I wish I could be more helpful with telling you more about this program, but I'm still learning it myself.  There is a lot of support on the web.

I'm going to rate this 4 stars, just because it isn't an easy program and it takes effort on the user end to make it a great program."
0.5,Seems to be working all right with my Vista Laptop. Haven't had any problems as yet. Easy to use too.
1,this company is greatest company i like Norton every year
1,"This program is an absolute blast to use!  Think of creating your own Wallace and Gromit style movies.  Of course, it is tedious, and time consuming (you'll be amazed at how short your film ends up being after quite a bit of work), but it can be fun as well.  The software is really easy to use, and it helps you along.  For example, you can overlay the previous frame on your current one to make sure you didn't move the LEGOs (or whatever your subject is) too far at one time.  The final product is surprisingly professional.

The only thing you need to be aware of is that this doesn't work with just any camera.  You need certain camcorders or DSLR cameras (listed in the product description) or you can simply use the computer's web cam.  Of course, that means two major drawbacks.  First, your built in webcam probably doesn't offer you very many options in aiming the camera.  Second, most built in webcams are very low resolution.  So while you can shoot HD video with this, you can't with your built in webcam.  The end result is slick, but too low resolution for most needs.

In the end, this is five star software if you have the right camera, but four star software if you don't."
-0.5,"As with others, I have used the Delux version for years without issue until this year.  I was irritated, to say the least, with having to upgrade for something as stupid as ""well, we want it to match the online versions we sell""!  What idiot takes away features?

Since i have been using this product for years, I did not want to have to change all of my data to a new system so I bought the ""enhanced"" product!  What a crock.  This version hounds you constantly to upgrade!!!!  Add to that the fact you cannot buy it without ""State Tax Forms""  (We do not have an income tax in our state, why am I paying for this?) and they really did find a way to make things bad.

To add insult to injury, now Turbo Tax says they will refund the difference you had to pay for the version change.  The Catch?  You have to give them your SOCIAL SECURITY number!!!!  Why?  so they can get your last years tax return!!!  What do they need with my Tax Return??????  They have no business knowing what my taxes are!  Why should i trust them with that information?  So, here they go turning a bad situation into an absolute nightmare!!

I absoluetly will NOT use this product again after this year.  If I have to, I will go back to filing a paper form before i will ever buy from this company again!!!

I give it two stars because the software does work."
0.5,I have been using apple computers for many years and I like most of the features they offer. However like a tic on a hound you will find like most other computer systems you must update in order to use many features on your computer. Example you buy Ilife 06 only to find that when your computer system updates a couple years later and you purchase a Iphone you must go get Ilife 09 to use some of the features in Iphoto. I am not sold on the changes made on Ilife 09. The vendor I got it from did a great job of selling the product for what it is really worth.
1,"Finally, a sub $100.00 8 port switch/router/VPN/firewall with Stateful Packet Inspection and everything you need to get your SOHO safely connected to the Internet. There are other's out there, but nowhere near the features at this price range. Setup in place of an older Linksys HPRO200 router/firewall was about 10 minutes including wiring and cycling the cable modem.  Rule sets will take awhile longer, but should be nice once it's done with configuration backup and restore features."
0,"Why did they change from a previously easy to use format? Last year one could go to a ""check return for errors"" tab and it would run a program to find mistakes. This year they buried this process in a way that is hard to figure out. I realized I was lost in the program and couldn't find out what I had overlooked or how to fix it- until I finally discovered I had to go to ""show all my forms"" where they had a tiny indicator ""not done"". [...]"
1,"We have 2 of these as our backbone for our 70 machine office. They are a bit noisy, but their performance is perfect.

Main points:
-Does not need to be a ""managed"" switch.
-Easy plug and go.
-Light enough to put into a U1 rack spot with just the from brackets.
-Uses standard UNC power cable.
-Fans make a little noise. Good enough to hide in a room, but not in an open space next to office workers."
1,"Download and setup of this suite was uneventful - download and installation took about 20 minutes. I wasn't even asked to restart my computer when it was done.  After installation, all the apps booted correctly and I was able to easily locate all my Office files in OneDrive.
Most of the work I do with MS Office is done on my laptop PC - my primary reason for having Office on my Mac too  is for the simple convenience of being able to access and work on my files if I'm at my home office where my desktop computer is a Mac.  For that, Office 2016 for Mac works flawlessly.  I keep all of my MS documents in the cloud via One Drive. Although i do the lion's share of my work on the PC, its nice to have that flexibility.  I've found the Office software runs smoothly and reliably on the Mac platform. Whether I'm using Powerpoint, Word, or Excel, it all works pretty much the same on both platforms.  I will mention that my Mac has an up to date processor, a solid state drive and plenty (16GB) of RAM - and El Capitan."
1,Great Product. Shipped Quickly!.
0.5,"I've got to say that I don't think I've ever seen so many 1 star reviews for anything here on Amazon.  So needless to say, I was VERY hesitant about upgrading to Quicken 2009.

When it comes to the world of personal finance software, we as the general public have very limited choices.  I've used Quicken since the DOS days and moved over to Money, then back to Quicken.  My most recent version was 2006.  I booted it up and it told me it was time to upgrade because they will stop supporting online downloads come 4/30/09.  Initially I was pretty hacked off...like a lot of others here.  Then I took a deep breath, and did the math.  I think my Deluxe version cost me about $20 somewhere (eBay perhaps??) so let's do the math together shall we?  $20/3 years is about $6.67 a year.  Holy Break The Bank Batman!!  Seriously people. Quit griping.  How about you not drink 2 Starbucks all year long and put it in your ""Upgrade Quicken"" jar.

This upgrade cost me $39 direct from Quicken and took 17 minutes to download.  So let's do the math for the next 3 years, shall we? $39/3 years is a wallet busting $13 a year!!  Skip your $5 footlong at Subway 3 times all year long and you can afford the upgrade...amazing isn't it?

The upgrade was flawless on my XP machine.  Double-clicked the start-up icon and away we went.  It found my previous version and un-installed it, installed the new version and ran for the first time.  It immediately found an update so I accepted it.  After the update, the program opened to the main screen.  All of my files imported flawlessly and I was downloading my newest transactions immediately thereafter.

One of the best improvements is how you can copy digital images into the register.  In my old version, I had to save the file to my desktop and then add it through a few clicks.  Now all I have to do is right click the image, click copy, open Quicken attachment and paste from clipboard.  Genius I tell you!

The interface has a very ""gel"" ""XP"" look to it.  I'm not a real big fan of that look, but I'm not going to rate it 1 or 2 stars because of it.

All in all, the upgrade, download, install and running of the program worked great for me.  So if you're reading all of these 1 and 2 star reviews, I'm living proof the program works, and works well."
0.5,Worked exactly as described. No complaints.
1,this makes doing my personal taxes so much easier. I like that it is quick as well does not require I be a real tecky person to use it. I  think anyone who would like to simplify the filling out tax process would love this product. I know I sure do.
1,Worth all four of the software programs which are included in this product.
0.5,"VideoStudio Pro X6 software is a great product that helps you with all of your video editing needs. Very user friendly.
Recommended."
-1,"Quicken 2014 is full of bugs.

In addition, if you wish to run an update you must first log into Intuit website first. It is not enough to know your bank accounts password, first you have to get intuits permission to access your bank.

This is a self serving economic ploy by intuit to keep you tied them.

It used to be a great program."
0.5,"If you're reading this you probably have already searched a variety of tech sources for the best antivirus software and, like me, consistently found Webroot near or at the top of the list. Buying antivirus software is one of the most dreaded computer-related task most people face  just reading the daily headlines reinforces that computer hacking is real and proper protection is necessary.  You want to make the right choice in buying antivirus software but there seem to be so many negative horror stories about antivirus software.  Heres why I ended up with Webroot.

The first thing I want to share is that I have been buying antivirus software for over 20 years, for business and home, and I am not married to any one brand. In fact, over time, I have bought and used nearly every brand sold.  And yes, some of them were true horror stories.

When WIN 10 came along I made the decision not to add any third-party protection at all to what is already part of the WIN 10 suite (Windows Defender).  While most independent experts agree that Defender isn't the best solution out there, they also agree that it is good enough for most people who use their computer for casual everyday use.  Defender has the huge benefit that it has almost no negative impact on computer speed or performance and it works totally in the background and never nags or bugs you (unless there is a reason to alert you to a problem). Another major benefit of Defender is that is updates itself (in the background) so you are always assured of being protected against the latest threats.

IF you want to add more protection to your computer but you like the positive benefits of Defender, Webroot is one of the best options out there.

SOME THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. Unlike most software there isn't really an old or new version of Webroot.  As long as you are running one that is compatible with your computers operating system Webroot works like Defender in that it is really merely an interface to their online services where all the actual smarts are located.  That is why Webroot won't work unless you are online.  You don't have to worry about updating to a new version each year or doing periodic downloads because (as Webroot calls it) it is always up to date.

2. Because Webroot doesnt install a large number of files directly on to your computer, it utilizes very little of your computers resources, thus most people will probably never notice any difference in computer speed or performance.

3. When the term of your license runs out you don't have to buy a new disc and reinstall the program. Buying a new license just allows the software to continue to run for another year (or whatever the term of your license is).  There is good news and bad news in that. The makers of Webroot don't seem to have figured out how to reward existing customers who want to renew their license. Instead, when their offer is sent to you as your license is about to expire their special price is ridiculously high. I mean all they're doing is giving you permission to use their software for another year, you would think they would/could offer you a special price for you loyalty, but no.  Which forces people like me to simply buy a whole new disc from whoever has it on sale for the best price at the time. Fortunately my renewal time is around Black Friday each year and I am able to buy a whole new disc for peanuts.

4. People who review Webroot usually have mostly positive things to say (except for the license renewal issue discussed above) but too many of them mention how Webroot has a nag box that appears on your screen every time you turn your computer on. Not true, or at least not fully true.  Yes that will happen, but all you have to do is uncheck that feature in the advanced settings box and you will never see any messages from Webroot unless you have an intrusion alert (or your license is about to expire).  The fact that Webroot doesnt have nag boxes is one of the major reasons I prefer it over Brands X, Y and Z.

5. When you first install Webroot it does a quick scan and tells you your computer is safe. Dont believe it. The FIRST thing you should do is force a deep scan. Webroot makes doing that harder to find than most of their competitors. To do a deep scan, open you file manager (the screen that shows you your hard drives) and right-click on each available drive, starting with your boot drive (usually your C drive) and choose Scan with Webroot.  Then sit back, the deep scan will take a long time, depending on how full your drive is and how fast it accesses files it can take up to a couple of hours.  There will be a dialogue box with a progress bar, how many threats were detected, elapsed time, etc.  Its best not to do anything else (multitask) at the same time until the scan is completed.

BOTTOM LINE

This is the third consecutive year Ive made the conscious decision to choose Webroot over other brands of antivirus software.  In that time Ive never had a virus infect my computers, Ive never noticed a slowdown of my computers performance, Ive never been annoyed by needless advertising popups, and Ive been able to protect 3 devices for a full year for about five-cents a day.  I like that."
1,H & R Block Software has helped me do my taxes now for at least 10 years. I had a question this year that I couldn't find an answer for and the live chat representative helped me with an answer.
1,This product is MUCH improved over previous versions.  It just works without getting in the way.  Check my review history because with prior versions I was no fan.  Now I am.
-1,"Highly recommend not installing this on your system.  It completely took over my office computers and eliminated internet access, disabled all our printers and cost us almost two weeks of manpower to somewhat restore things to normal.

Uninstalling Norton 360 caused extensive damage, we had to reinstall multiple programs.

I would like to see a class action lawsuit against them to recover time and wages lost trying to fix the problems they caused."

0,"WARNING: TurboTax 2007 requires Microsoft .net software. Don't use TurboTax 2007 if you don't want to add, or don't have room for, .net. It seems like many programs I add (TuroTax 2007 is an example) require additional software that causes my computer to slow down more. Thus, numerous software additions cause numerous additions to computer slow down. I am mad at Intuit because I don't want .net; I wanted only TurboTax."
-1,"This will give my experience with Fix-It Utilities Professional, which took place over about a week of using this program on our home network.  We have three computers:  (1) HP Pavilion Slimline desktop PC (mine); (2) HP Pavilion Entertainment notebook PC (my husband's); and (3) Dell Inspiron notebook PC (backup/auxiliary).  All three run Windows 7 Home Premium with Internet Explorer 9; the HPs had Kaspersky and the Dell had McAfee for virus protection.

Installation was fairly easy on the two computers running Kaspersky.  On the HP laptop, it mostly installed except for the malware/antivirus program, which it would not load until Kaspersky was disabled.  For my HP desktop, Fix-It loaded everything.  For the Dell PC running McAfee, we ended up uninstalling McAfee and installing Kaspersky first.  We did try to install Fix-It with McAfee disabled but still ran into problems, i.e., we simply could not install Fix-It at all with McAfee.  We were going to take McAfee off the Dell anyway.  Once we had Kaspersky loaded onto the Dell, it still took three hours to load Fix-It because we kept getting error messages saying that the program had stopped functioning.

I was not unfamiliar with this type of performance program, having run TuneUp Utilities for the previous year with no problems whatsoever.  Fix-It offers most of the same features as Tune-Up, including pc analyzer, registry repair, one-click pc maintenance, program optimizer, and browser acceleration.  The file shredding and lost data recovery functions were enhancements over TuneUp.  Ironically, Fix-It advertises the ability to stop ""frustrating PC crashes.""  Well, we did not have any PC crashes before installing Fix-It.  About three days after installing Fix-It, both my computer and my husband's started experiencing the ""blue screen of death.""  For those of you unfamiliar with this unpleasant phenomenon, the entire screen goes blue with writing to the effect that Windows has encountered an insurmountable error and is going to shut down.  All data in progress at that point is lost.

Over the next four or five days, both of the HP computers experienced several blue screens.  We have had these HP's for about three years, and prior to installing Fix-It, we literally had never had any blue screens on these computers. Both my husband and I have been using pcs for over 20 years and are fairly experienced, but we do not have the patience, much less the special expertise, to deal with constant blue screens and the potential damage they can do.  We therefore took Fix-It off all three computers.  Since uninstalling Fix-It, the blue screens have stopped.  In particular, uninstalling Fix-It from the Dell turned out to be a royal pain. Under these circumstances, I cannot recommend this program."
1,"As someone who has used quickbooks on PC for a while, I agree with the other reviews that its still a lot better for the PC for said reasons already stated.

For new users who run side businesses (like bloggers, etsy sellers, etc).  Quickbooks is a pretty robust program that can help out in many of your accounting duties.  The product description pretty much covers all the relevant features.  My experience is that the program is a bit hard to use for those who haven't adopted many software applications outside of the Microsoft Office apps, but relatively easy for those used to learning new applications."
0,"This suite offers an impressive array of features including a virtual keyboard and safe money. Having garnered much favorable press and high scores for performance, I was looking forward to enjoying its protection. While it installed without issue, it does not work well with Firefox. The scans and updates are painfully slow and since installing my computer really drags. Frankly I could live without the added features in exchange for speed. My experience with Kaspersky products has generally been positive and this software does offer good protection. But the performance issues are a serious negative. I would suggest using the free trial to determine whether it is right for you."
1,I have used tax cut for the last 5 years with no problem.  I will use again.

The only provision for claiming excess railroad retirement tax on Form 1040 is for tier 1 withholding. The excess can be derived from a combination of railroad employers or in connection with a railroad and non-railroad employer. The program does properly record the excess of the tier 1 tax on line 67 Form 1040 as a credit against income taxes. It does nothing with the tier 2 excess tax. This must claimed separately, as you noted in your email, on form 843 which is not supported by the Turbo Tax software.

The software's help does contain information regarding tier 1 and 2 railroad retirement withholding. The help clearly indicates that only tier 1 may be claimed as a credit against current year income taxes. It goes on to state, ""You cannot claim a refund for excess tier 2 RRTA tax on Form 1040. Instead use Form 843."""
1,"I have been using Norton's Anti-Virus programs for years.  I have found, as I reach the end of my subscription period, that I can obtain a better price by going to Amazon and ordering the new subscription, than by ""renewing"" directly with Norton.  Saves me $20-30 per year."
1,"I never had a problem learning the english language or acquiring new vocabulary. Why then did I have a mental block learning a new language? Could it be the boring, repetition and grammer ? (yup!)

I am very pleased to report that I now can converse in elemantary German thanks to the Rosetta Stone learning system.  Imagine learning can be fun!

The total immersion approach teaches you a new language the same way you learned your first one through visual and contextural clues, repetition and a very cool speech analyzer that helps with pronunciation.  The Rosetta stone approach is the best thing next to a personal tutor since it is so comprehensive long time to download , probably because of server traffic.

I must admit, it took a while to build my confidence.  It has been a long time since the rigors of a college classroom.  At middle age, wasn't it supposed to be a bit harder for me to learn?  What I found, is that the mind is like any muscle.  With work, your can grow more nimble and strong.

The self pacing aspect of the program, makes it easier to remain positive and focused on progress and not worry about ""falling behind"".

I am really enjoying the challenge of learning a new language.  I look forward to adding other languages.

The software is of excellent quality. I find the photography outstanding and the voices attractive. It might sound silly to remark about this, but the user experience is intoxicatingly fun.

The big question, ""Is it worth it?""  For me, it is a definite ""Yes"". Although the software is a high price, it is by far the best ""learning experience"".  Since you want to learn a language, why not put the cost into perspective? If a cheaper product, turns you on, then go for it.  For me, the Rosetta stone experience makes me want to learn. That is worth the price of admission."
0,"MS Outlook has been invaluable for emailing, calendar, reminders etc. for quite some time. Outlook 2007 tried to add more features and functionality but unless you upgrade to Word 2007 as commented by other reviewers you lose some of the word processing features.

-1,"I am a systems programmer interested in human factors and usability. For that reason, I very strongly dislike Microsoft Windows, etc. Years ago, based on that dislike, I purchased a Mac G5 2.0GHz swearing to Mac and never look back.

I only lasted six months on the Mac as it was even worse than the PC. Currently, I have been forced to use a Mac exclusively for the past few months so I upgraded to OS-X Leopard hoping that things would be better?

They are not. Apple had that snob-oriented ""Think Different"" ad campaign almost ten years ago. Not ""better"" but ""different"". Almost entirely unusable if you are in the least bit discerning.

1) Installation was reasonably painless
2) Crashes, etc. Had to upgrade from 512MB to 1GB.
3) Crashes, apparent memory leaks? Had to upgrade from 1GB to 2GB.
4) Absolutely no accessibility for people with epilepsy. Blinking cursor cannot be disabled. Stupid ( ""Think Different"" ) rotating colored disk that comes up at the most inopportune moments. ( this is epileptogenic for some people ). Stupid rippling progress bars ( ""Think Different"", again. Unfortunately Microsoft has gone to this abomination, too. This, again, is epileptogenic)
5) Worthless help and documentation ( even worse than Microsoft )
6) Apple applications are generally junk. Preview is worthless but you are basically stuck with it.
7) Idiot bouncing dock icons that DEMAND attention. Again, epileptogenic
8) File management is a PAIN. ""My kingdom for 'cut and paste'""
9) Totally idiot ( ""Think Different"", as usual ) implementation of ""invalid password"" when switching users. The whole display frame vibrates, so to speak. I have seizures every time this happens.
10) Boot times take about ( at least ) twice as long now. Before, Leopard, we would turn off the computer. Now, we can't as it takes too long to reboot. When switching back and forth between our two accounts, in mine, the mouse speed is always hyperfast when I log in. That I don't understand. Once I open an application it reverts to the speed I set in preferences.
11) As far as crashes, i've lost count. ( this is a simple installation with nothing unusual, btw ).

OS-X is so unfriendly, unusable, undocumented that, to me, it is worthless. I would throw this Mac away if it were mine. ( I made a mistake of having my ex-girlfriend get a Mac as I thought it would be easier for her to use then a PC. BIG MISTAKE ). I don't use computers because I like jerking off with them; I use them to get work done on them. Apples are  for snobs, not people.

Comments:
1) Microsoft is trying to out-apple this lemon operating system and Vista is totally inaccessible to people with epilepsy, too. If you have photosensitive / pattern sensitive epilepsy you had better stock up on XP computers.
2) If I had to chose between the Microsoft Vista juggernaut and this Apple Leopard lemon, I would chuck both computers. Hence staying with XP 'til death do us part. ( XP is fairly inaccessible, too, but at least you can disable the blinking caret. I notice that any newer, Vista compatible application that also runs on XP, is generally inaccessible. The trend seems to use indeterminate progress bars ( the ones with the group of squares rapidly cycling across the progress bar or the one ( used by Norton Internet Security ) that ... Both of those cause very unpleasant seizures. I can't tolerate this Apple blinking cursor as I have trouble so enough"
1,Great product
1,"If you're used to using WordPerfect, and don't want to change to the more common similar program, you'll love upgrading with this very reasonably priced product.
If you are new, this is user friendly and easy to install."
-1,"I just bought a new computer that runs on Vista.  Installation of TurboTax was impossible.  I kept getting the UNHANDLED EXCEPTION 0x80040707 ERROR.  I went to the TurboTax support site for help.  The information they provided did not solve the problem and the only available next step was to submit my email address.  The Quicken reply message was not helpful and only stated that they will email me when they have a solution to the problem.  Cold comfort for someone who bought the product that is supposed to be Vista compatible.  Shame on you, Quicken!

FYI...I installed it on Windows XP without any problem eventhough it did take quite a long time for the installation.  So, if you have Vista, perhaps you should find another tax prep product."
1,"This software was required by our daughter's college and we were able to get it here for a great sale price and free shipping. Since it has three licenses included, we loaded on on to our son's laptop and our home PC for their use too, and this really was a great savings for us. The logic behind the icon and function in Excel and Word totally continues to escape me, seems to lack logic really, but it is functional and, as noted, a great deal here."

On both machines, it works flawlessly, all but invisible in the background except when it encounters and intrusion.  It has a lot of flexibility in its options, so customizing it to suit your needs is easy and intuitive.  The only con I can mention is that when accessing an external cloud drive, the Norton systems can cause a lags in transfer speed, so if you use such a drive to stream movies and music to your television, Apple TV, Roku, or Blueray player, you may find it necessary to disable the protection.  Other than that, I give this application high marks!"
0,"PrintMaster is just fine if all you want to do is use the built-in templates to make family newsletters, simple brochures, greeting cards, and stuff like that. I tried to use it for something a little more (but not much more) advanced -- a program for a roller derby bout. I found it difficult to work with, and the help system didn't work at all.

If you just want to use the templates to do simple stuff, this is a fine choice; but if you want to do anything on your own, you're probably better off with a more powerful program."

I've seen many negative reviews for editions of previous years and I don't understand. Some were awfully suspicious and most complained about having to pay for extra features rather than the product itself. Some people want more for nothing... The 2015 edition hits the spot though.

Sage continues to be the best accounting software I've tried. Whether you run a small business or something very tiny out of your home, Sage is worth it.

Pros:
-Easy to set up, use, and learn. Obviously learning comes easier if you have an accounting or reporting background.
-Runs smoothly and without error after a couple weeks of use.
-Sage has upgraded! Lots of features and the interface looks good.
-The software helps you determine which tools are most beneficial for your needs.
-Good for forecasting and managing inventory."

0.5,"Electronic devices are like bunnies. Every time I turn around there are more of them. McAfee LiveSafe is a commendable program. It may be basic but it is good. First off I like that you get protection for an unlimited number of devices. The program is downloaded and installed easily. I used it on two android phones and a guest computer. It operates without interfering with  performance or speed. The protection is adequate although for my work computers I need more comprehensive protection.

If you are looking for affordable, basic protection for multiple devices, this product is definitely worth considering. It is affordable, effective, easy to install and use and does not slow you down. It is basic but good. Recommended."
-1,"Sorry Microsoft, but your ""ribbon"" user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever. It renders all your Office applications useless. I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again (I'm not even sure if it's even possible to customize the ""ribbon""). The ribbon is ugly and WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY too big.

My advice: try to avoid upgrading for as long as possible."

0.5,"I don't feel the need to dive into depth in this review, as there are so many other good ones here. As always, Family Tree Maker is a solid product and worth the investment. The feature suite is rich and it gets the job done nicely. Where my real complaint lies is the map. This has been a feature that's been in the last few iterations of FTM and, while I love the idea, the implementation drives me bonkers.

The idea behind the mapping feature is that you can attach people and events to actual locations on a map. It's great for setting up to-do lists, getting a visual look at your family history, and so on. The problem, however, is with formatting. I have yet to figure out what it insists locations be entered as they are. For instance, I have ancestors buried in a cemetery in ""Baileyville"" TX. This is, of course, how I've entered them. FTM, however, doesn't like ""Baileyville, TX"" and gives me a ""?"" beside any entries. Basically, it can't find ""Baileyville"" in its database. And yet, on the map view, it drops the pin right on--you guessed it--Baileyville, TX! So it can't find Baileyville, TX in its database, but seems to find it just fine on the map. Go figure. At others times, it will insist on a County for a location and, even when I duly enter it in, will still kick it back as being somehow wrong. There really seems to be no rhyme or reason to when a location will be kicked back as unrecognized. This is sad, too, because the feature is really nice when it works. It's helped me clear up some sloppy editing (like when I once entered ""Grimes Co, TX (Last name was spelled <edited>.  Age was given as 64.  Occupation listed as farmer.  Real estate value listed as $47,000.)"" for a location!)

Perhaps I shouldn't be so harsh, but this is a feature that's advertised prominently and has been around for years. There are ways around these issues, but none of them feel reliable to me (and ancestry software should be reliable above anything). If they could fix these map problems, I'd give it 5 stars in a minute. Until then, however, I'm keeping the pressure on.

(Long story short, great software, but the mapping piece can still be annoyingly inconsistent)"
0.5,"I've said it before and I'll say it again... this is a wonderful software package. The accounting and inventory portion of this software is premium by far.

But not much else has changed since the 2013 version. But it is still BOSS over the Sage 50 Complete Accounting 2014 software with more features, but you would think with Sage getting raked over the coals from the 2013 version about removing the Payroll Processing / Tax features and making them a completely seperate add-on, that they would have heard the cries of foul. Not so! They are definitely sticking to their guns on this one. Given a few years down the line, nobody will even remember that they were once a singular product under Peachtree. Also, in order to create and report on payroll checks in your Sage 50 accounting solution, you are required to get a Sage Business Care Gold or Platinum subscription.

Although you are getting a wonderful accounting and inventory software, they are continually throwing additional add-ons and sales pitches to buy even more of their products. It's pretty annoying after a bit.

One of the catches with this software is that it is auto-renewing. So in order to activate this software, your going to have to give them your credit card number in order to get started. Personally, I feel this is an over-the-top lock-in, so to say. They should be more like your anti-virus subscription, letting you know that your subscription is about to expire, giving YOU the option of renewing instead of them just automatically renewing.

So if you put alot of work and investment into your accounting and inventory, using this software, they kind of have you and your business hostage. So you better know right off the bat if you are ready to make a true commitment to using Sage 50 Accounting software, because that is truly what it is... a commitment!

As I stated before in my 2013 version review, if you are a small business or very small business, this is probably an investment that you more than likely should avoid, unless you can really work it into your budget and can absolutely commit to using this software. However, if you do not need the the Payroll & Tax software, then this is indeed a wonderful and premium accounting and inventory software."
1,TurboTax makes doing business taxes easy.  I have saved hundreds of dollars in doing our business taxes with this program year after year...and feel confident doing so.  I even found errors our prior CPA made in years past.  Will continue to use TurboTax for Business and Amazon always has the best price.
0.5,"When we switched from Office 2003 to 2007 at my workplace, I thought I would go absolutely crazy.  Mostly when using Word because that is where I do most of my own writing and editing.  The familiar toolbar with one-word functions (file, edit, view, etc.), and drop down lists, were gone and replaced with these strange tabs and a new color scheme.  And ""file"" disappeared altogether, replaced by the ""Windows Orb.""  To this day I find Office 2007 awkward.

Enter 2010, thank goodness, because 2007 was not a joy.  Office 2010, at first glance, looks just like Office 2007.  Yes, it still has those weird tabs and no, they did not replace the drop down lists.  But 2010 has the ""file"" button back!  Stange how much difference that makes, but I'm an end-user and it makes my life easier.

I'm still not crazy about these new tabs.  They're so much different to navigate than previous versions of windows.  And then there's the ribbon.  There's a ribbon for every tab (function), and you have to click on the tab to get the ribbon.  Really, what the ribbon is is the drop down list spread out across the screen!  It does take some time to get used to this change.  Previously Office users had a horizontal/vertical toolbar.  The tabs and ribbons make it a horizontal/horizontal toolbar.  It's like putting the steering wheel on the console.  Sure, you can drive it, but it's awkward at first.

So, functionality?  Better than 2007.  It has a cleaner, sleeker look, but more functions.  Just a little here and there; for the most part not a big departure from 2007.  Except for Outlook.  2007 Outlook has email, calendar, contacts, tasks, journal, to-do lists, sticky notes - just too much stuff.  It is absolutely a cluttered mess if you try to use all that in Outlook.  By the time you open all those apps, you've got no screen left in which to navigate!  I only use email for email, contacts and calender, anyway.  2010 shovels some of the bull, I mean extraneous stuff out of Outlook and puts it in One Note.  Outlook is cleared up and if you want to use One Note, well, there it is.  It reminds me of a Franklin planner or Moleskine journal.  Electronic, of course.

The software doesn't take up that much space either.  Of course, this is Microsoft, so you do understand I mean it takes up relatively little space, don't you?  Altogether, far better than 2007.  If you're still using 2003, it's worth upgrading to 2010.  But because it's pricey, if you're using 2007, you might as well stick with it till they come out with Office 2010 Professional 2.5.1.2.4, unless you're really flush."

Shame on Amazon too, for letting this guy sell bogus software.

1,OS X Tiger is a great upgrade that significantly increases speed and reliability. No more spinning beach ball of death.

The previous posters that claim crashes and no speed improvements are Microsoft plants

-1,"Excellent review and very true. Gone are the mighty and high Kaspersky days. Pure user for few years now, but with recent upgrade to Win 8.1 it has been nothing but headaches and licensing issues - 3 months without protection until they released a patch in late Dec 13, and they will not even have a courtesy to extend the previous license which did not work for 3 months. They spam my email everyday to buy at some f'in exorbitant rate. Seems like they have become greedy as they have grown, a sure sign of downward slope for such companies. I now started hating Kaspersky products and their licensing practices. To all Kaspersky users out there, let this be a warning / caution."
-0.5,"TurboTax 2007 caused me hours of wasted time. If I hadn't noticed that it didn't deduct what I had entered for section 179 depreciation, then I would have paid thousands more tax. Other people had the same problem based on what I saw on their support forum. I suspect TurboTax 2008 will also have its share of bugs and problems. SO CHECK YOUR RETURN CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU FILE! Also, expect it to nickel and dime you when you want to do a relative's return (or someone else's) after you've done your own. But I'm going to be nice and give them 2 stars because the competition also has its issues.

0.5,Don't use as much as expected.
0,"Corel tried for a light office suite that would be appropriate for netbooks and machines without much in the way of resources.  They created a suite that has the basic functionality and flexibility that consumers have come to expect.  It's nowhere nearly as polished as Microsoft Office, but that is, in part, the point.

However, Corel has to contend with competitors like OpenOffice, which is free.  I can't figure out why someone would pay for this suite when she could get OpenOffice and its equivalent functionality for free.  In the end, that's what makes this product somewhat superfluous to me at any rate.

Your mileage may vary.  If you're looking for an inexpensive suite and don't like OpenOffice, then check out this Corel product.  It runs fine on my wife's Dell netbook."

1,Works as intended.
-1,"The software itself may be fine (I've used the Professional version on my own home systems and have no real issues with that product) but the lack of any -- as in none, zero, zilch, nada -- customization options during the install of this product and the incredibly frustrating process of activating (the activation process) for this particular version (Home and Business 2013 - Retail box) of Office make it NOT RECOMMENDABLE for anyone's purchase and use, most especially not for use in an environment with multiple systems.

Sadly, it seems that Microsoft absolutely intends this product for use for a HOME user, or a small business user who is working from home -- which, uh, tells me that they don't quite understand the meaning of the words ""and Business"" when they use it as part of the product name.  Apparently they are, yet again, apparently trying to change the meaning of the words here.

Any BUSINESS, and especially any CORPORATE user should be looking into the mystifying world of Volume Licensed products and the joy that is getting those products installed.  Hopefully it would be easier than the nightmare that this particular retail packaged offering includes.

Until Microsoft digs their head out of their nether regions this one goes to the top of pile of products to avoid, at least as packaged here."

What I mean is, you are supposed to download the driver (CDROM or online) and then install the card. Windows XP recognized it immediately and it works as advertised at 480 Mbits/sec. If you must know just one important thing about USB 2.0, remember not to unplug the peripheral device when the PC is on. Power down first, then unplug the device, be it printer, digital camera, external HD, or cordless microphone. It could result in a crash and/or data loss (Thanks to Christine for this word of advice)."

-1,"The only reason I upgraded from 2012 is because they were cutting off my online access (which I think is a rip-off).  This version is just like the prior version and I don't see any improvements.  And it still pops up ads occasionally when I launch it.  Spamming your customers via their financial software that they PAID for is tacky.  Shame on you Intuit.  I have already dumped QuickBooks for one business I operate, and we are looking to dump it for another business.  And yesterday I dumped TurboTax for H&R Block because Intuit stripped some forms out of TurboTax Deluxe to force an upsell.  Now this may be my last Quicken purchase too if a viable alternative presents itself in the next three years.

If you continue to treat your customers as nothing but constant upsell targets you will continue to drive customers away.  I have been a customer for over 20 years.

I also had a problem getting my ""Intuit ID"" to work and learned the customer support phone number provided on your website is a sham.  When called it just says to go to the website and then hangs up.  Again, shame on you Intuit.

UPDATE 2016-01-16:  After a recent update to the software, now it forces me a view an advertisement popup every few times I open the program.  Reducing the rating to 1 star because of this.

0.5,"This was my first time using Quicken. I mainly use it to track spending in my checking account, as well as my retirement accounts. It does have the capability for tracking investments, mortgages, etc., but I was mainly looking for a way to track my spending.

It was easy to install and for the most part, is intuitive to use. I use a password to update my accounts which only takes about a minute or so to do. Initial imports required a lot of manual categorizing, but Quicken adjusts to how you want things categorized and all following imports required little manipulation. Of course, sometimes I have to go back and re-categorize transactions, but it doesn't take up too much time.

To me, the spending reports are invaluable. I can see exactly where my money goes - last month, last 3 months, etc. It's a great way to start some budget planning and beats tracking expenses manually. Like I said, there is a slew of other capabilities, but for me, even using it for my limited purpose is worth while."
-1,"I have had three computers brick with Windows 8.  Two were brand new laptops and one was a one and a half year old desktop PC.  All three had the same issue.  When booting up for the first time everything seemed to go fairly well, once logged in things were a little laggy and unstable and required updates.  Once the updates were almost all installed it began doing the required restarts and thats where the problems bagan.  Some of the updates were broken causing an infinate restart loop until eventually (sometimes days later) it would say there was an error installing updates reverting to previous installation.....that was good except for it never did revert and only stayed on the ""reverting to previous version"" screen forever.  I returned the two laptops for a refund and had to buy a new PC even microsoft support said to return them and they were toast.  Garbage."

I tried (free) downloads of movie players, but they really didn't work as well. This version works great and can play Blu-ray Disks, files on hard drive and preforms very well. If you are in need of a very good player for videos, this is the one."
-1,"I was happy to get this software today.  I anxiously installed it.  The first thing was that a newer version was available, so I tried to download and install it.  It failed, and an error message came up saying there is a ""known problem"" and ""strongly recommended"" a manual download/install.  It provided some very confusing instructions, but I'm fairly competent with computers, so I managed to manually download/install the new version.

The most disturbing feature was that during every restart of the computer, prior to Windows loading, a Acronis page appears, making you select to go to one of the Acronis applications or you MUST select Windows to go to a ""normal"" Windows startup. I went to ""MSConfig"" to the ""Startup"" and ""Services"" tabs and shut down anything regarding Acronis.  But I couldn't kill the Acronis startup page.  So, I explored the program, under tools but didn't find any help.  There was an ""Options"" button, but it didn't work (deactivated?).  I looked under ""help"", again without results.  I tried ""Customer Service"" links, but they were deactivated (I wonder why???).  I tried looking though the history of problems others were having, and was amazed that such a new program would have volumes of problems reported already.

So, I went to the control panel and uninstalled the program.  Unfortunately, afterward, the Windows backup and restore functions no longer worked.  I was able to complete a ""system restore"" and recovered the Windows backup and restore.

I use Windows backup and restore and Norton Ghost, but I'm not going to touch a Acronis product again!  Yuck!"

0,"Quite simply the best.  I tried various other ones over the years and they never come up to the level of Family Tree Maker.  That is not to say that they have not made some missteps because they have.  One version was so slow that it was basically unusable if you have a large file.  Not so with the last few iterations.  It still starts slow but apparently that is in exchange for working at a decent speed once it is up and running.

This one works well and plenty fast even with a very large database.  Of course one of its strongest features is the way that it integrates with ancestry.com.  You can search ancestry.com from inside the product and then import the information directly into your family tree database including pictures, copies of the pages of the census records and similar.  If you are new then it provides you with the resources to quickly build your family tree.

The only real problem with the software is the user interface.  There are places where I wonder what they were thinking.  I created a report and spent several minutes trying to figure out how to print it.  I looked in the frame where the report was located and there was no print icon.  Click File and no print option.  Right click on the report and no print option.  Then there it was.. a tiny printer icon way up in the right hand portion of the screen where there is normally only the minimize and close icons.  Some of the ways of navigating the screens are also less than intuitive.  However, once you get it all figured out you can breeze through reports, importing, exporting, and getting your family tree built and published if you desire.

Remember to build your tree quickly as it comes with a 30 subscription to Ancestry.com and if you sign up and forget then it will charge your credit card each month until you remember to cancel.  Personally, I never liked a system that did that and believe it should warn you when the 30 days is about to expire and let you then agree to a monthly subscription at that time.  I know it is common but it still raises and ethical issue is my opinion.

Still the best product on the market today for building your family tree."

If the install fails, all you need to do is right click on the executable file and select ""Run as Administrator"" and it should install fine.  My account is already an administrator account, but I still have to do this to install this software for some reason.  All is fine now!"

The activation screen has an option for if you have already activated the device. If you notice it, you can try that route. However, it asked for my email and phone number and found no account, apparently their bug because when I went to norton.com I could log in from there. Once in my account I found that I could download to the device from which I logged in. I have had other problems with Norton in the past. One  year I returned it. My take is that they did a poor job of testing there user interfaces and provided inadequate documentation for the current release."

0,"So, I thought it would be easy to use to convert our video clips from our camcorder into Facebook-ready format.

First, I opened a file to view. Looked OK, set the mark-out point. Now, how do I move it into the timeline? No obvious way to do so. After looking in vain for an icon that might say ""Add to timeline"" or something, I decided I had to move it from the thumbnail list into the timeline, which I did.

But now the preview is in low-res, and jerky to boot. I've already noticed how slow the program is to respond to moving of markers - takes 1-2 seconds to respond - but now it's even more noticeable.

Now, how to convert it to a suitable format? No obvious shortcuts for that. There are options to create DVD, Blu-Ray, etc. There's Batch Convert, but you have to select files to convert. Does this mean it'll be trimmed as I want? Dunno. ... Ah, here it is - Share tab, then Create Video File. OK, there are plenty of formats. Good. I select one and watch the low-res, jerky playback while it works. Finally, it converts, without any trouble.

If you've the patience, this program has the usual features such as tracks for effects, titles, audio, overlays, etc. as you would expect, and canned templates for authoring videos, and a good number of output formats. But dang, this thing is slow when you're positioning markers. And this is on a Dell M4400 with 4Gb RAM. Not sure whose fault it is.

So keep that in mind that this may not apply to you..  but it crashed on install and I couldn't use the product.  I would try it on my newer computer but I am reluctant to have all my defaults changed.
1,A great deal on Norton Antivirus! You can install this older version then upgrade for free.
0.5,"I am yet to put it tru its paces but so far no problems, no freezes"
0.5,"Autodesk is attempting to go the Adobe Creative Cloud route, with a subscription-based service and, apparently, a grudgingly offered boxed version of the same software. Like Creative Cloud, your $3/month or $25/year gets you the latest updates of Sketchbook Pro for as long as you pay. Given that this is $60 software (often reduced to half that price) and the glacial pace of updates (seriously, how slightly different has each version of Sketchbook been?) I can't see how this is a good deal at all. Buy the boxed version with its perpetual license and use it for years until Autodesk builds in some real, significant new features.

But here's the rub: most smaller laptops and tablets these days don't include a DVD drive. In the past, I have bought the boxed version of Sketchbook and used its serial number to activate a trial version downloaded from Autodesk's site. But Autodesk has made this process unnecessarily complicated now. What is easily available to download from the Sketchbook site is not a trial but ""Sketchbook"" - notice the missing ""Pro."" This is an entirely different version of the software and seems to be an untimed trial version - and this may have all the features most people may need! If you install this, you will not be able to activate it. There is simply no way to do so in the software.

Those of us with devices like the Surface Pro or the past couple of years' worth of MacBook Pros, iMacs, and Mac Pros need to go through a rigorous routine of hoop-jumping. Sign up on the Sketchbook site, register the serial number, sign up on the Autodesk Support site, find the section for Installation And Licensing, follow the link from there to Autodesk Virtual Agent, search for the proper software, download it, install it, put in your serial number and product key, and FINALLY have access to Sketchbook Pro. This ranks among the very worst software installation experiences I have had. It's utterly ridiculous to need to go through all this just to get to the REAL version of Sketchbook Pro. Autodesk is trying to force users of modern computers into their subscription model by making the process maybe not impossible, but extremely annoying.

As for the update, it's minimal, depending on your needs. The biggest new features are the ability to use onion skins in the new Flipbook panel and a perspective tool, plus new selection tools. These are ""nice to have"" but not necessity features, and I find it hard to recommend even a relatively cheap upgrade price for just these features. Flipbook is going to appeal to those making animations. Those of us just drawing single images in the program are likely only interested in the perspective tool... which, again, is only ""nice to have"" because if we've been drawing a long time, we already know how to deal with life without a perspective tool. If you have Sketchbook Pro 6, in other words, there is little reason to upgrade. Everything you already knew and loved about Sketchbook Pro is still here, working pretty much the same (there have been very minor improvements in handling layers.) Weigh what these features mean to you if you're considering upgrading."
1,"I had used Pinnacle Studio 17 plus. I found it a little clunky, but it was usable. I was sad I got plus because I didn't realize there was a higher ultimate version and there was no way to upgrade. So this time I'm glad to be getting ultimate.

Things that are new for 19:
-Project Bins--a bin that you can throw a bunch of video/sound that you want to use, or a way to put video/sound into a organized bins without having to move the videos from the folders they really are located in. The bins contain video links, not the actual videos. This is great for me. I like having my videos organized by time and events. Also I have tons of videos and pictures in one folder. This allows me to grab the best and bin them without creating duplicate video folders and taking up more space. It helps me not to have to go through a folder with hundreds of pictures/videos over and over again. I love this feature! (And they needed to add it since Adobe Elements 13 added it)
-Even more effects--like I didn't waste enough time already over effecting my home videos... Thankfully there's now a favorite section so you can put your favorite effects where you can easily get to them.
-Multicam support--If you have a party or wedding or wherever you might have more than one people videoing, it's pretty cool to be able to jump around the cams. If you have audio for your videos, it even tries to line them up automatically!
-Support for more file types and better 4k support.

When you open it up, it looks very similar to 17 or 18. It's an evolution and refinement with more features. It's good to know they didn't change everything! It's run pretty smoothly so far, but I have a pretty powerful computer. I don't have anything higher than 1080p to play with, but I've not had issues. I do suggest you use the system requirements as a very minimum requirement. I wouldn't try running this on anything less than an i5 with 8GB of ram and would prefer to have an actual video card in there too--and that may still give you a lot of waiting when crunching higher res video. I wish Pinnacle would give you a suggested computer setup for different levels of performance. I'm running it on an XEON 1650v3 with an NVIDIA Quadro K2200 and 16GB of ram. That's basically the equivalent of a high end i7 and a GTX 750. You're going to have a completely different experience running this on your $400 laptop than a performance machine. Video editing takes a lot more processing than picture editing.

But I was able to trim, split, combine single and multiple HD videos with no issues. I could have saved in many formats and DVD. It does bluray with an additional purchase. But, disk based media is practically dead. I'm just glad it lets me save it as a mp4. It will also export to Facebook, Youtube, and Vimeo.

My understanding is that Pinnacle provides little if any support. And I think that's the main disadvantage over Adobe Premier Elements. I can google all sorts of issues with Adobe Premier Elements and find all kind of help. It may be slow support with a strong accent, but I can call Adobe. Pinnacle Studio does have tutorial videos on their site and on Youtube. It looks like more videos for 19 are coming and most of the 18 videos do apply. There is a knowledge base in the support section and the ability to email support (free for 15 days from purchase...). If it works great, you're good. If it doesn't work for you or you have problems with the program--good luck...

But for me it's been working great. It hasn't crashed once. The way it works makes sense to me. If you're still deciding, go to youtube and search for ""Pinnacle Studio 19 Ultimate - Basic Editing Beginners Tutorial"". That will give you an idea of how the program works. I think Premier Elements is a little bit easier for a beginner, but I think it's easier to do some more complicated things with Pinnacle Studio."
1,"I've wanted Corel Draw Graphics Suite for several years but my budget always got in the way! I purchased Corel Draw Essentials, older versions of Corel Draw, and a home and student version. None of these satisfied me! What has satisfied me is Corel Draw Graphics Suite X6. It has all the features I want. easy to navigate, and has a 300+ hard cover guidebook! Since I am familiar with earlier versions of CorelDraw, I haven't had occasion to use the manual (yet)... but what I did discover about the manual is that offers a lot of ideas for the tools that are part of CorelDraw and I probably would overlook the possibilities. This is a first-class graphics suite in every way and inclues not only CorelDraw X6 but also Photo-Paint, Power-Trace, Website Creator, Corel Capture, and more. I like Photo-Paint, a professional photo editing application. If someone asked me if this is worth $500, I'd certainly say, ""Yes!"". Believe me, you'll get your money's worth with this edtion of CorelDraw. Additionally, there are 1,000 professional Open Type fonts, thousands of photos, images, and templates. There's also a two-hour training video to supplement the manual! CorelDraw Graphics Suite X6 functions as smooth as silk! Highly recommended."
1,excellent
0,"There is a lot to like in this this small and simple suite, but it is not comprehensive nor is it compatible with any of Microsoft's products. Since Word, Outlook and Excel are enterprise standards, it is important to have a compatible office suite. With Wordperfect, this is simply not the case. Wordperfect chokes on the simplest VB scripts, is not compatible with Office tables and macros and such a foreign interface that any reasonably qualified office worker would find it a hassle. It is an XML-based word processor, however, and this is good for writers/workers who are also capable XML programmers. I have never had a publisher, editor or evaen a college course that allows the WP format in any setting. The reveal codes is a neat gimmick but it is only helpful because formatting Wordperfect documents is so difficult to start with (I am speaking as a secretary and publisher myself). If you want your office production to operate smoothly and easily for all of your workers, WordPerfect is not an option. The bottom line is that WP is not easy compatible, or as thorough as any version of Microsoft Office. If you care about compatibility and your company's bottom line, spend an extra $50 and get the suite from Microsoft.

On the other hand, if you have no need for compatibility or efficient production, get Wordperfect, it is smooth, good-looking and is well-supported by Corel who continue to improve as a company (owned by Microsoft)."

Make sure you buy the correct antenna cable to hook up to your router as this package does not come with it."
0.5,"Windows 7 Home Premium is the best version to choose for older machines and/or simpler networks.  The ""Backup"" offered in 7 Pro can be done easily with free tools, and unless you need complex networking, 7 has what it takes to manage a home network.  Last, the 'XP Mode' promised in 7 Pro and above will only work on hardware new enough to support ""Virtualization Technology"" (stop by Microsoft's website to learn more).  This isn't the same as ""XP Compatibility Mode"", which you will still have for all versions of Windows 7 (there's a great video explanation of this on CNET's website in their Windows 7 Center at CNET TV).

Some very important things you need to know about upgrading:

1) There are two types of upgrade:  ""in-place"" (where a Vista machine upgrades to 7 and you get to keep all your programs) and ""clean"" (where you lose all your old programs and settings).
2) Anyone going from XP to 7 will have to go ""clean"".
3) Anyone going from a different Vista to 7 (for example, Vista Home to 7 Pro, or Vista Ultimate to 7 Home) will also have to go ""clean"".

If you have to do 2) or 3), all is not lost--I'll explain in a moment.

Before you even buy 7 for your machine, stop by Microsoft's website for two things:

a) download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor.  Run it with every device connected to the machine that you'll ever want to use in 7.  It'll thoroughly examine your machine for any roadblocks and give you good advice about upgrading.
b) Go to the Windows 7 Compatibility Center and double-check anything that came up negative in the Upgrade Advisor (or didn't show up at all).  This site lists detailed compatibility info on a LOT of different devices.

Anything major, like a video card or sound card driver, I'd recommend double-checking with the manufacturer's website to be sure.  This almost burned me on two of the machines that I upgraded.

Last, make a backup.  There's a free tool called Macrium Reflect that can do this for you.

Do you have to do a ""clean"" install, but just want to carry over your user accounts and settings?  Microsoft makes a program called Windows Easy Transfer that's already in Vista (and can be downloaded from Microsoft for XP) that will export your accounts and settings and let you import them back again.  It's very easy to use and does a good job of putting your accounts back together again, even going from XP to 7.

Do you have to do the ""clean"" install, and you don't want to reinstall all your programs?  Laplink has an offer for $19.95 that will let you use a special version of their program ""PC Mover"" to upgrade one machine one time.  Read the documentation in detail.

The most important thing to doing a ""clean"" install is that in the Upgrade setup you choose ""Custom"".  Windows will take all of your major files and place them in a folder called ""Windows.old"".  PC Mover and the Easy Transfer program will use this folder to reconstruct your system from, so this is VERY important.

I wish I had more space to go into detail here...bottom line is, if you plan ahead a bit, upgrading to 7 will go very easily (and if it doesn't, you'll have something to fall back on)."

1,"Wow, I am finally out of the dark ages with Wordperfect Office!  Some very neat features, such as the password protected pdf files.  I, for one, did not need that feature, but I am sure there are some out there that do!  Installation was a breeze and it's very easy to use and navigate!"
0,"I'll update the review after a while of using it. For now, it seems to work fine. The installation went without problem (I uninstalled all of my previous security software first). It works as described so far, but as everyone knows, you really can't be sure how well a security program is working until you've used it for aa while and it's been tested by real attacks.

The only time it slows down my machines is when it is engaged in a deep scan (which can be scheduled), otherwise, there have been no conflicts with other software (a first for me), components, systems, etc. I have been using it for several months now. It works and its easy. Finally!

When i was told that i may have a virus (by a bank of america website tech support person), I ran a complete deep scan with Mcafee and it was not able to locate or remove the virus. After much Internet research, the most recommended solution was to run microsofts free antivirus software (there are two different free products and I installed and ran both). The free microsoft antivirus found the Trojan and one other virus and removed them. A little more research comparing the Microsoft anti-virus and Mcafee all access revealed that this Mcafee product does not handle Trojans or malware!

1,don't be fooled by freebies or the one that comes with the OS.  I've been using Norton for years and the program is the best.
1,"Several years ago I purchased the online access to Rosetta Stone.  I don't know if that is still available but the months went by and I ended p paying a lot of money.  I actually don't think there is much difference between that and this....the features that I remember re all comparable.  I didn't end up using it enough.  Really, you should just pay for what you need and I believe this is what I need.  I took a year of Spanish in college and I just don't remember enough and I need to learn it now.  I can't wait to see how quickly I progress with this.  I will update.  If you are trying to decide which software to buy, I definitely recommend this.

0.5,"THE QUICK TAKE:  Instant Immersion Spanish offers a lot of content for a reasonable price.  Like all language programs, you get out what you put in - it takes work.  This package is a reasonable option if you're looking for a less-expensive way to start to learn Spanish.

FULL REVIEW:

Instant Immersion Spanish has a number of features that reflect their experience in offering language programs:

+ There is a diverse range of content and different ways to learn, which is important with language: computer software, tablet software (for Level 1), a DVD and audio.
+ A PDF of the audio script is included, so there are written materials as well.  I like to see the words, not just hear them.
+ This new version allows multiple members of a household to use the software.  In my opinion, that's essential for language software, so each individual can pick up where they left off.
+ The software can be installed using a download, which is very helpful for the newer devices that blur the lines between tablets and computers (such as our 2-in-1 laptop with no optical drive).
+ The tablet software is fairly nicely done, though it could be a little better.  It offers a few different learning approaches (listening, speaking, spelling, multiple choice).  I find the tablet (in our case, an iPad) works particularly well with children - and easy to pick it up and get started, anywhere.  No need to sit down at a computer.  (Of course, it makes me wish it covered all of the levels.)

But there are some concerns:
- The DVD seems to use Spanish as it is spoken in Spain, rather than in Latin America. While the differences are modest, that's a surprising thing to do to new learners.
- The DVD lessons are OK and worth doing, but not particularly effective or appealing.  They need an update.

One other thing to note, if you're planning to use the audio while driving - it's a little complex for that, though you could review or preview it that way you'd still want to listen when you can give it your full attention.  Also, it's unfortunate the audio doesn't start out with a little conversational Spanish, rather than 3-4 lessons on the alphabet.

Given the value price and the substantial amount of content, I wanted to like Instant Immersion Spanish more than I did.  I'd give it a moderately positive recommendation, if you're looking for a budget option.

I suppose my expectations were fairly high, as I've used a number of different approaches to language learning and inevitably compare Instant Immersion to the best of each of them.  So I compare the audio to Pimsleur; the tablet app to DuoLingo; and so on.  Instant Immersion wasn't the best in any category.

The bar has been raised in another way as well: with so many free resources available through the internet, language software has to offer a lot of value for the price."
1,omg this router is amazing
0.5,"I've installed on four computers so far; everything went well on three of them. The fourth had a third-party Firewire 400 card, which made installation impossible. The system would reboot halfway into the upgrade, spitting out the DVD. Nothing would break, but the installation failed without producing any kind of error message. The only solution, ultimately, was to remove the card, run the upgrade, and then re-insert the card.

That done, the software seems to work. My printer (an old Xerox Phaser) is supported, as are my scanners. The driver for one of the scanners crashes when trying to save to a particular format, but the manufacturer has promised a fix and it's anyway easy to work around for now.

I'd call this 4.5 stars if that were an option."
1,"I have had issues with my Quickbooks working properly on THREE of my computers. It has given me nothing but problems. I can't say the same for Sage 50. This program has been nothing but perfection for my computer. I haven't had any issues with running it or keeping everything updated. The program is easy to understand. I am not familiar with any other Sage 50 products. This is my first software by them and I am really impressed with how well this is laid out for even the least computer savvy person could wrap their brain around.

It meets all my needs in keeping all my financial information in order and I actually feel SAFE with this which is something I didn't feel when running Quick Books. I feel like my information is protected and that every little detail I insert into the program will be safe.

So far, highly impressed and would recommend. Well worth the steep price!"
-0.5,"TurboTax is a product I love to hate.  Of course Intuit is the monopoly and TurboTax is an Intuit product.  Why did all my other Mac Address book addresses blink in and out as I typed my registration name?  Even when I wasn't typing, the field kept on blinking.  It was as though Intuit was uploading all the names in the addressbook.  Then, when I looked for the use agreement, I couldn't find it to see if I had somehow agreed to give them my addressbook names???

Moving along, the TurboTax program's wording was better but still bad, leaving customers in the dark, even if we could read. The program crashed repeatedly while trying to copy my files to CD so it really can't do that.  Other than that, it was a little faster and easier, I suppose due to more interaction with the Feds and California.  Was my return right?  I doubt it. I think Intuit is still in a bit of a conspiracy to aid the governments in exchange for their networking.

The worse part was in the end when I saw the steep prices to file online.  There, true to Intuits form, I truly felt very RIPPED OFF!!!  I wondered if its lone large competitor, Taxcut, was the same way?"
1,"This program is a great way to learn a language. The method of using pictures with the text helps you make associations and learn much faster,easier and more fun than just memorizing words. You do need to be self motivated but I found myself looking forward to the lessons. The program will automatically recommend to repeat a lesson if you make too many errors. I love that you can have up to 5 users so others can learn along with you and that makes it a good value for households that have several members who would like to learn the language. I think it would also be a good family activity/project and learning with others would be great for motivation and practice. The audio companion CDs are a big help to reinforce and practice what you have learned.
I had no problems with the software installation and set up except for some reason the software could not detect my wireless connection and I had to register by phone."
0,"Corel has been around since the mid-1980s, and for many of us has been a good source of good computer software at a reasonable price. The company expanded into video editing software a few years ago with the acquisitions of Pinnacle Systems (Pinnacle Studio) and Ulead (VideoStudio), which was rebranded as Corel VideoStudio.

Having familiarity with both of these products, the choice of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-VideoStudio-Ultimate-X7/dp/B00IIL0S8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X7</a>&nbsp;as a Vine choice was obviously interesting for this user. It's good for those looking for a budget- friendly video editor that can perform all of the essential functions without getting very complicated. It offers an intuitive, well-organized layout, though since you can only have one video track on the timeline may limit what you can do with your video production.

The minimum system requirements to install VideoStudio Ultimate X7 aren't very much, but for the best possible performance, Corel recommends ""an Intel Core i7 or AMD Phenom II X8 processor with a Windows 7 or Windows 8 64-bit operating system and minimum 4 GB of RAM. For editing of 4K video, a 4th generation Intel Core i7 processor is highly recommended.""  I had installed this software on a PC notebook with a Pentium Dual-Core 2.2GHz CPU with 6GB RAM and running Windows 7.  After a slow install, at first everything seemed to be running well, but soon it seemed to develop a case of hiccups, to put it simply.

The few short videos that were produced were fine, but perhaps due to my hardware, the software had a habit of occasionally shutting down, and one time caused a reboot for unexplained reasons.  The software does allow for installation on two systems, but as of the date of this review, have not installed it on my more powerful  Windows 8.1 PC with 8GB RAM.  Your results may differ widely from mine.

If you're looking for a video editing program to get your feet wet, so to speak, you may wish to look into the newer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-VideoStudio-Ultimate-X8/dp/B00T0I6J4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X8</a>, which has many more features and stronger reviews.

0.5,"This product allows you to do some really professional editing. However, as a novice it was pretty hard for me. The reason why I gave this product 4 stars is because it was easy to install and it really works to allow you to create really neat videos. However, I don't want people to think this is simply ""plug and play"" for a novice, you really need to spend time with the help menu and get to know the program before you can really start to see results beyond what you can do on ""video editing"" programs that come on the computer. In the end, it works great - if you are willing to spend the time learning it. Glad to have it and will use it more as I learn it."
1,"One downside is that your subscription days do NOT add to the days you have remaining, but replaces them (If you upgrade directly through the program it does add to your days, but it usually costs at least twice as much for some reason). Because of that, you should wait until you only have a few days left on your subscription."
0.5,"Even though Antivirus+ is the ""low end"" Trend Micro version, at $7.39 currently for one computer, that is a bargain, especially since it even includes cloud technology; it is a huge step up from relying on shareware or other free software which may or may not offer the kind of protection that this brand has been known for for years.  Personally, I do not need most of the bells and whistles offered by the Internet and Maximum Security versions. This is because I already have a utility program that provides PC performance tools, do not care about shredding my files, utilize a separate password program, do not want to spend the time to ""sync"" my computer with my phone or tablet, care about WiFi only at home, and am not a social networker.  However, if these activities are of concern, then Antivirus+ is too basic, and you should consider the other two versions.

It is imperative to uninstall any other antivirus program you are running before attempting to install Antivirus+.  I installed it on a computer running Windows 7 with Internet Explorer 9; the entire process took me less than 10 minutes.  All of the settings, as well as access, are very intuitive; there is an icon in the lower right-hand side that will control everything from a drop-down menu.  It is very easy to set the program to automatically update and run scans.  Note that when you set up an account with Trend Micro, of course you also have to enter a password, but as additional security, all of your program settings are separately password protected as well, so for simplicity's sake, you may wish to make the passwords the same."
1,"This product is simply amazing, and, as far as I know, there is not anything else like it on the market. For anyone who is serious about art and digital art, this software by Corel is a must have. I have only begun to use it and am just blown away by all of the features and functions, and have to agree that it is definitely like having a ""mini art studio"" right at your fingertips, though my own knowledge of art and drawing is quite limited. My granddaughter is quite the artist in the family and has not been able to stay off of the computer when she visits, since I installed this program. She has produced some remarkable work with it (mostly with the basic functions), but I look forward to her spending more time with the software. I am already impressed enough as a novice to know that this software is fantastic, has a gold mine of features which we have not yet explored, and deserves my highest rating."
0.5,I installed this with no difficulty and it seems to be working like a charm.  I'm quite sold on Norton.

There are problems with this product--as it is not as effective as others in it's antivirus protection (viruses and malware attacks--missed alot of common virus and malware items during a test.)  The only features that were improved were the parental controls, user interface, and it is easy to install.  Which is not enough for me to consider this product.  Trend Micro needs to improve this product more before I would consider this my only PC security."
-0.5,"This was my first experience with Anime Studio software. Most of my animation experience with low key - using rudimentary type programming. While I am sure this program had the best of intentions, it is really not for the beginner. To get things to happen takes a lot of effort as things just aren't set up intuitively. Even the tutorial seemed to start in the middle of the program. It didn't start by explaining what terms meant, what was the purpose behind the features, etc. While I understand this software is often used by people who are really good at animation - there is a ""beginner mode"" and it never really treated me like a beginner.
I was also disappointed that you are immediately thrown into needed to ""upgrade"" to get creations to do the really neat things shown on the package. The start-up page presents you with options to buy additional characters. The developers should maybe take a lesson from Ap developers - first reel your customers in, then hit them with a desire to upgrade. Don't brag upfront about how I am going to need to spend more money to do the really ""cool"" stuff.
I just couldn't in confidence recommend this software to anyone. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for the novice or beginner. And, I am too green with the software to know if it is the right fit for those who are much more advanced in Animation. The software just doesn't seem to know quite who it is targeting.
I gave this software a lot of time to see if it would grow on me or if I would have an ""a ha"" moment and it just never happened.
I guess the good things I can say about it was that it installed easily and you can get started within minutes. However, getting started is too strong of a word for my experience. It was more like - look through a tutorial and get stuck at the fourth page. Then, spend a long time try to make something cool happen only to never accomplish anything beyond changing some colors. I also didn't like that the software was constantly pushing me to download more content (free and paid). I was still trying to figure out the home page and I kept getting prodded to do more. Every time I tried to really work with this software I ended up frustrated."
0.5,"I have used Toast software for years for my disc burning needs. I have used it to convert EyeTV recordings, copy CDs & DVDs (noncopyrighted of course!) and convert video files. I have a love/hate relationship with this software.  It will work flawlessly for 20 discs and then the next 5 will be coasters. I have tried various brands of media and I see the same problem with all of them. Thank goodness the cost of blanks has come way down over the years.

The interface of Toast 12 looks nearly identical to Toast 11. I did not notice any performance increases in 12 over 11. The only really new feature added is Live Screen Capture. It allows you to record directly from your screen and add voiceover. You can then share the recording as a video. It works well, but products like ScreenFlow have a ton more features and allow for more editing capabilities.

Needless to say, it does do what it claims to do  allows you to capture, copy, convert & burn. It is still one of the software programs I will have on my Mac. If you have Toast 11, it really isn't worth the cost to get Live Screen Capture."

This product makes your every day work more difficult.

The pricing is ridiculous.
The installation gives you no options."

Science and other technical users need to be made aware that Microsoft has removed Visual Basic for Applications(entire suite) and the Analysis Toolpack from Excel 2008.  Be careful that Microsoft does not in fact sell you a ""downgrade"".  For business users the suite is excellent.  Everything seems to run well and is very stable at least on my Macs."

After i got it installed though i was able to reinstall malwarebytes and superantispyware just fine."
0.5,I helped an older lady buy this since I recommend Norton to everyone I help with computers.  The only issue is that when it comes time to renew I either have to help them renew or they go on the auto renewal program with Symantec.  The problem is that auto renewal is usually much more expensive than just finding and buying it online or on sale locally and using that product key.
0,"I'll be honest: I don't play a lot of BDs on my PC because I have a decent BD player, and my desktop isn't the place where I usually end up watching movies. That said, I have to express my belief that CyberLink has somewhat improved their PowerDVD Ultra suite since previous versions, and if you're in need of a good media software suite, CyberLink's is something to consider.

Not only does it handle the disc-based media, but it also scans for local media on your hard drives, and plays back just about everything. I was a tad disappointed with their movie title and information detection-- The CyberLink version just isn't as good at it as those devices and apps that search the IMDB or TMDB, frequently getting titles, descriptions, and box art wrong. This is because they use their own service instead of relying on the established ones on the Internet, and it translates to being a weakness in their software. I had to fix a lot of movies' info after the software did its initial scans.

The 3D conversion seems spiffy, but if I'm honest I'm not a fan of 3D movies, and so all I can really say is that it did seem to work to some degree, but that your mileage may vary. Some movies work better than others.

CyberLink is fairly generous with cloud offerings, and they play nice with DLNA. No complaints here.

However, the software did run a little slow at times, and I'm sure these times were when PowerDVD was connecting online... It seems like many actions in PowerDVD require it to check something online, and that bogs it down a bit.

Playback is clean, crisp, and as you'd expect of commercial media software. However, as noted it starts up a bit slow, and I really didn't see any major advantages over freeware like VideoLan when it comes to local media in various formats.

CyberLink PowerDVD's best feature is its ability to play Blu-ray Discs on your Windows PC, because Microsoft doesn't include that ability in the Windows OS (licensing, etc. prevents it). If you're a laptop warrior and need to play BDs while traveling, CyberLink PowerDVD is probably your best option. It handles menus, sub-menus, added features, BD Live, and all the other functions you've come to expect of the BD format.

So my final rating; Three stars for a desktop PC where BD playback is secondary to your needs, but that bumps up to four stars if you're in need of decent BD playing suite for your laptop.  The two stars I docked were for the poor data matching for movies, and for the slower loading speeds."

Immediately after ""checking for incompatible software"" it stops the process and says it didn't install. I entered the new code and it says it will activate as soon as the old code expires. I guess this means that Kaspersky 2015 will work for another year. Next year I will try something else. I have Windows 10."

-1,"Had Paperport 12 Pro on Win XP/sp3
Forced to move to Paperport 14 Pro when installing into Windows 8/64. Earlier versions of Paperport will not work in Win 8/64. Most off the shelf laptops and desktops will have 64 bit Windows 8 installed.

Users of PP12 will see a familiar interface in PP14 but will definitely have problems in Win 8/64 getting your scanner/printers to work. Win 8 requires printer/scanner manufacturers to rewrite their USB and LAN drivers.  Your Brother printer/scanner must have the latest firmware BEFORE installing Brother USB drivers for Windows 8. My Brother MFC-7860DW scanner/printer will handshake and scan to PP14 only over the LAN connection, but PP14 will print a hard copy over the USB or LAN connection to the Brother printer. Go figure. Brother really has problems posting the correct sequence to update their drivers to work in Win 8.

PP14 is great for organizing your scanned images whether they be done in tiff or pdf. That is why I have been using Paperport since they became the default big dog when they bought out Pagis Pro some years ago. Yes, there are other document scanning/sorting/filing programs but Paperport allowed you cut/delete and paste from one document to another. Whether it was pdf/pdf, tiff/pdf, or pdf/tiff. This is a tool I use extensively.

UNFORTUNATELY, Paperport 14 Pro has broken the RESIZE tool.  In PP12 you could resize a document or image larger or smaller.  Important if you scan a business card and want to enlarge it a bit for easier reading or shrinking something down to fit better on a size of paper.  The Resize tool is there, but no longer works, no matter if you want to increase or decrease the size in inch/cm/mm or DPI you now get a what the heck ""The requested size is too large. Please use smaller values or reduce the image DPI values.""  You have to cancel and ""be happy"" with the what you get is what you get. So that business card you have with 100 lines of mouse type is still going to be 100 lines of mouse type printed business card size on a 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper.  This ""BUG"" has been noted at Nuance help forums since early 2012, it is now September 2013.  Nuance has been consistent on their product updates and support, zippo, zero, nada. Their update notices are merely upsell notices to upgrade.

If you have Windows 7 or earlier keep your Paperport 12 or look for Paperport 12 if you do not have it. If you have Windows 8/64 you should look to alternatives.  Try FileCenter trial version first.  If you really want to try Paperport 14 Pro then download the 15 day trial/demo version of Paperport 14 Pro.

If you find something that worked in PP12 but is broken in PP14 do not expect it to be fixed at all by Nuance.

I am currently stuck with a reduced feature Paperport 14 Pro because I have Windows 8. I think I will increase my loses and quit Windows 8 which I have had for 2 weeks and buy Windows 7 for a Windows ""upgrade"".

Tech/Phone support is MON-FRI. HUH!
Online chat support with off shore reps work more days. They are OK but the language syntax may throw you once in a while.
Free Tech Phone/Web support for 90 days, after that you pay $9.95 for help. No support for trial versions.

UPDATE 008/11/2016 downrated to one star
Paperport 14 Pro has been working in Windows 7 Pro/64.
Tried PP14 in Windows 10 64bit and program does not close in Windows 10.  Must close using task manager and force close.  Will continue to use in Windows 7 but not on Windows 10 machines.  Noticed price drop so maybe a new version of Paperport is coming out that actually works in Windows 8 and Windows 10.  The cut and paste feature in PP14Pro is the only thing keeping me using this ancient software."
0.5,"I've been using Corel and PowerDirector over the years. I like them for different reasons. Corel has always been pretty user friendly, so if I want to quickly edit something, that's what I use. The interface is easy to use, the program has a number of templates, drag and drop effects, a variety of filters and transitions and professional looking titles. It's also easy to load video, edit in the timeline, and make a cohesive movie to upload to the internet. You can also create video in a few different formats. So, for beginners, this is a great program.

If you're a more advanced video editor, I'm not sure this is for you. You may need more effects and bells and whistles. But for the home user just wanting to transfer videos of the kids or vacation, or for the small time vlogger (which I've used it for many times), this program is just fine and well worth the price."

I love the setting of 'Danger' - the island beaches, kayaking in the cove, bicycling with your helmet on, exploring hidden tunnels and the lighthouse, eating chowder at the restaurant, etc.  Younger detectives may need help and even older ones may need to check the web site I mentioned.

I hope it's as interactive and interesting as ""Danger on Deception Island""."
-1,"If you have lots of time on your hands and need a new hobby, this package is for you.

Bitdefender used to be a top line product.  Not anymore.

After you buy the product, before it installs, there is a 25 mb download of the ""latest"" version.  Then after you install, it needs to download another 15 mb ""update"".  When the install doesn't work, as it didn't THREE times for me on a vanilla Windows XP machine, you have to go through the whole routine again.  And again.  And again.

The biggest problem is that there is no system tray icon to let you know that the program is actually working.  I happened to open the program from the desktop icon recently, and discovered that the real time protection had been shut down at some unknown time in the past.  With no notice that I was running unprotected. This is simply unacceptable.

When I tried to get tech support, their plan was for me to spend an hour or so collecting some huge data files to send to them.  As if that would explain the tray icon problem.  More wasted time.

Then there are the scans.  My machine has less than 12 gb total in files, on a 10,000 RPM WD Raptor SATA hard disk.  It takes Bitdefender over an hour to scan, and it wants to do this frequently.  Slow, slow, slow.

I suggest that you do what I'm doing, and try something else."
-1,"I would just like to know why Quicken doesn't resolve software issues with their product.  Ever since I upgraded to 2014, last year, the product is buggy and slow.  I have a relatively new computer so that isn't the problem.  I have gone back to entering data manually for my 401k.  I bought 2015 to see if this version corrected the bugs from 2014...it didn't.  It was the same products as 2014.  I tried download my information from one of my accounts and it was messed up!  I had to restore my from a backup to get back my original data.  Why can't they even get my net worth correctly?  I update the prices and they show the correct amount in the accounts balance on the left, but if I go to REPORTS, the balance doesn't match the account balances on the left.  It used to be a good product, but without competition they don't care.  Microsoft Money used to keep Quicken improving its product."
-0.5,"I have the limited edition with exclusive bonus pack which provides ""over $250 in extra value"" of a 2FB USB flash drive, KPT collection plug in, Corel Painter Essentials 4, and Corel WinZip 14.5 Pro. Mine came with a short quick start guide (which was too bare bones to be helpful) and a small page size 137 page paper guidebook. The fact that Corel issues different packs, some with a user manual and some without is something that some customers are upset about.

I own and older edition of Photoshop Elements (a less expensive pared down version of the professional Photoshop) and am used to PS Elements. I will note that PaintShop Photo Pro X3 is the same pricing as PS Elements and from what I have been able to figure out, the two programs are very similar in content as well.

Before I tell why I am dissatisfied I'll share my opinion that if you already have a photo editing program, you probably should stick with that product and buy updates as you feel are necessary. There is a large and painful learning curve when moving from one software to another. I just learned this the hard way. The terms are different, the process is different, and it's just too painful to put oneself through unnecessarily. I am asking myself why I bothered to want to try PaintShop Photo Pro X3 when I was happy with (my no longer latest version of) Photoshop Elements. I guess I was thinking maybe this was better and why not get this and stop using PSE? I'm sorry I wasted my time. Before I say why I don't like this program I'll give more info.

I am looking for very basic photo editing tools. I take photos with a DSLR but am more into the actual taking of well composed and well lit photographs than I am into spending hours of my time editing shots.  What I want photo editing for are some simple things such as: cropping photos, resizing photo files to make them smaller when necessary (i.e. submitting photos to newspapers and websites), to remove red eye, to make a soft edge on a photo and perhaps to adjust an overexposed or underexposed photo.

Regarding projects, which this software does, I'm honestly not sure how I would use this. When making a photo book I would make it right on the site that professionally prints the book. When I make a photo Christmas card I make the soft edge on the photo right on the warehouse store website.  When I make a photo calendar I used the warehouse store's website to create it from home on the internet, and they print it and I pick it up at the store.

I have a six month old computer PC: Windows 7 Premium and an i3 processor. It is not yet clogged up with too many files and had plenty of room on it for new programs. Installation was easy and took me about 90 minutes only because I would walk away and realize there were many steps and it was waiting for me to keep clicking more boxes.  I was confused though, over having to install multiple programs all from the same CDROM, and was unclear what the differences were between: Paintshop Photo Pro X3, Project Creator, Painter Essentials 4 and KPT collection (that one I did not even bother installing). I did the registration online; there were no phone numbers for me to call. Some reviewers mentioned ads on the screen, I saw no ads. I have over 30,000 photo files on my hard drive at the time this was installed. I don't understand why other reviewers are saying it took hours to load this software given the number of images on their hard drive.

The instruction manual was promising offering 4 ways for new users to learn to use the system: the Corel guide, the Learning Center palette, the help system and web-based resources. Despite this seemingly wonderful array of options when it came down to figuring out how to do something as simple such as resize a photo to scale it down to 72 dpi I could not find the answer. I still can't figure out how to see if it saved the file as jpg or if it is saving it with some other format (i.e. raw, gif). I was annoyed that searches with common keywords such as `resize' turned up no results. I could not find any of this information in the user manual either.

When working to edit a photo I was annoyed that multiple images I was not using were lined up at the bottom which it randomly pulled off my hard drive, it was distracting. I am used to working with a program where the only thing on your work surface is what you have chosen to work on right now. I found that I could adjust the viewing box to get larger that pushed those off the screen.

The absolute worst thing about this program which is why I am uninstalling it and giving up is ---- the program over-wrote my existing program to view photo files that were already on my hard drive. When I try to open a photo by clicking on the file on my hard drive, it opens in the Corel Instant Viewer which is a piece of garbage that first pauses for 2 seconds doing nothing while it loads, then it shows an image for 2 seconds in a pixelated blurry mess before sharpening up to view it. Moving to the next photo using the arrow, such as to view photos you took on a certain day, takes 4 seconds to load each photo and my eyes go crazy with the sharp to blurry to sharp to blurry images. I cannot stand this Corel Instant Viewer.  It is impossible to quickly click through the photos. My old software from the Canon camera would instantly load with no pause and it would immediately be in perfect focus. This thing that Corel has is ridiculous.

After spending 4+ hours installing and trying to edit one photograph to just crop it to zoom in, reading the user manual and the online help, just trying to get one photo to convert to 72 dpi and jpg format, and not being able to figure it out, I give up on the program and am going back to Photoshop Elements. The simplest editing task should not be that difficult to figure out.

At at the very least a photo program on a brand new, high speed computer should not take 4 seconds to load one photo image and make us look at it for 2 seconds blurry first - there is no need for such madness."
0.5,"The installation went flawlessly. I opted not to install Business Contact Manager.

The Outlook itself is quite complex and useful for managing your workflow in a busy environment. If you need a tool to just manage your personal email, there are, probably, less heavy tools.

In 2007 edition Microsoft added a ribbon on the title bar of the message viewer. This ribbon is a customizable bar with buttons. One change that I didn't like comparing to 2003 edition is that in order to edit a saved message instead of simply selecting ""Edit"" in a drop-down menu, one has to either find ""Revise Contents"" or add it as a button to the ribbon. The whole indivudla message window interface is brought in line with all Microsoft Office 2007 look, but the Outlook's main window still looks like 2003 with some changes in the menus.

I don't like the changes to the Search functions interface. Now to search a folder for a message with a keyword you have to navigate to Tools>Instant Search>Advanced Find -- right-clicking on a folder in the Mail Folders' pane won't is not possible any more since there is no option for searching in the Folder rclick pop-up menu.

One can go to Tools>Instant Search>Search Options and set ""All Folders"" in the ""Instant Search Pane"" area and hope that every time you start a search it would go through all folders. Nope! If you don't check ""Search Subfolders"" after pressing ""Browse..."" button in the Advanced Find, the search will NOT go into the subfolders. This means that either this feature doesn't work or the interface is confusing...

I definitely don't like the hard-shell plastic packaging: it take a lot of space, hard to see where it's sealed, and opening it was a challenge."
-1,I wouldn't normally suggest this but do not upgrade!  Vista takes the only good thing about Microsoft products - which is the advantage of an interface that you already know - and breaks it.  Vista really is different than any of the previous versions of windows but in the worst of ways.  Here's a typical example.  Want to do something simple like search for a file?  Too bad!  They have a much faster version of search with just one problem - no place to enter the search criteria.  Overall I think that the only people who have gained from Vista are Apple and Linux users since there should be more defections with the Vista fiasco.
0.5,"Maybe it's just me but Office applications seem to have become much more user friendly since I began using them umpty-gazillion years ago.  The addition of Publisher and Access to this package is welcome, but to be honest, I'd prefer a more comprehensive publishing solution to be added to Office Pro.  Why not add Front Page?

That said, the ease of both installation and maintenance has also improved with a quick download and a few minutes of installation during which you can actually use Office.  The templates are simple to download and use, and each application has been made more intuitive, at least to my way of thinking.

With the install you get some Skydrive space with an option to buy more.  I find the whole Skydrive thing a bit confusing, but I like it as a backup for my files.  The free space is more than enough for me; I find it pretty generous.

All things considered, I think Microsoft's suite of Office applications has improved to the point where I'm not spending most of my time yelling at the computer while I work.  That alone makes it worth the price."
1,"We get the upgrade every year, and, while the changes are not huge, the program is excellent to begin with, and they do improve it every time.  This is no exception.

This has always been the best genealogy program, in my opinion, and it still is."

It finds some things that other programs do not (and other programs find things that this does not).

Cons:  Cost.  Ad aware and Spybot search and destroy are free.  Also, I'm not sure how up to date they keep their database.  Its one of the OK programs if you decide to pay for one.  E-trust's pest patrol has had better reviews (Maximim PC).

-1,"iPhoto has a long ways to go before becoming a great organizer. Events seemed like a great idea when they were released in iPhoto 08 but the trouble with them is that you can't put events inside of other events. The reason this is such a problem is that after you load so many thousands of photographs there becomes to many events and it becomes cumbersome to sludge through them all.

Their solution to this problem in 08 was the add the ability to merge events together. When this happens everything becomes one large event, it doesn't maintain the groups of the events you merge together. I guess I can forgive them not totally thinking this feature though in iPhoto 08 but nearly a year and a half later they should have got this right by now. Adding events inside of events is a lot more important than even features like faces and places.

Doing a search is also limiting from the search box. You can't set multiple search criteria at a time like in the Finder or Adobe Bridge. In other words I can't say show me the files with these keywords that were taken during this time period and have this rating. I can only do one at a time. Yes I can do this with a smart folder but I would like to have option not to since I don't always want to come back to the search later.

Posting to Facebook and Flickr only gives you access to some of the features on those sites. You can't enter in all the information about the pictures from directly with in iPhoto (captions for photos, who can see the pictures, what should be the key photograph for an album etc.) Also iPhoto doesn't pull the previous albums you created back in to iPhoto so you can only view some of your albums not all of them.

If you ever have to move your information to a new hard drive down the road all the work you did to put together slide shows won't come across with the rest of the photos. I found this out the hard way as a spent a lot of time setting up manual Ken Burns effects so that they would pan from one particular area of a photograph to another. Now the only way a can access them is to boot back and forth between my old hard drive. It is a good thing I happen to have two drives in my machine or I would have to recreate them. I imagine this is what you would have to do if you had a laptop.

The recent area on the sidebar only shows the last event you look at. This is ok but I would like to see a history of the last several events I viewed. The last 12 months area doesn't organize those photos by events so you just gets this massive number of photos which isn't very convenient."
1,"My netbook has many hours of home video files stored on it that I wanted to share with family.  Using Nero 2014 Platinum and a USB DVD writer, I have had success burning these movies.  Read on to find out what this software can really do!

Installation
I installed Nero 2014 Platinum on my Acer Aspire V5-122P-0637 netbook.  The AMD quad core processor and 6Gb of memory seemed more than enough to try out video editing on my favorite portable computer.  The installer detected that I needed Microsoft XML 4.0 SP3 and a reboot validator so I had to restart my system to complete the process on my Microsoft Windows 8.1 64bit machine.  Upon reboot, I entered my serial number and began the file install.  Approximately 15 minutes later Nero was installed.  The content pack took another 10 minutes to load.

First and foremost, before Nero 2014 Platinum was installed on my Acer Aspire several of my movies could not be played because their file extensions were not recognized.  After installation, the MKV video files could be played.

Next, I burned a digital copy of a movie I purchased to DVD+R Double Layer disc using Nero Video.  The process took 2 hours 35 minutes to complete, mostly because of the transcoding process.  The transcoding used all four cores of my AMD A6-1450 cpu.

Extras
The Nero 2014 Platinum installation DVD also features content packs.  You will find video effects, themes and menu templates in this collection of content.

In conclusion, Nero 2014 Platinum does a fine job of editing and burning movies."
1,"I have it on 3 PC's, 2 iPad's, 2 iPhones absolutely fantastic.  Can't hardly beat free  ;)  Thanks Amazon. So far loving Prime and Instant video on my iPad, iPhone, Boxee Box (first purchase on Amazon), and Roku"
1,"I have a new Alienware X51 computer I purchased with Windows 7 and PowerDVD installed on it.  For some reason, Dell still is using a version that's three versions behind, version 9.  When Windows 8 came out I upgraded because I figured the metro UI would work better on the 10 foot interface for a media center PC than the start menu and such.  Got it upgraded, and PowerDVD 9 still worked in it as the program, but it lost the integration with Media Center - no more functional PowerDVD option from within the Media Center UI.  I played around a bit with other programs, such as the iDeer program (which ran, but had no integration with Media Center, and the media center remote couldn't even pause/stop/play.  I have a current version of Corel's WinDVD 11 but that won't even RUN on windows 8, and nothing from them saying they're going to make it functional.  So I looked back at powerDVD.  They had decent pricing for the digital download, just a buck or two more than here at Amazon, so I purchased it today.  Downloaded it and the extras, uninstalled version 9 from my Alienware, and installed 12 Ultra.

Immediately I noticed I had the integration with Media Center again, and it works.  Remote works also (I use a Harmony Touch).  Then I tried the two free IOS apps you can get with the Ultra edition, the remote control, and the media streaming player.

At first nothing would connect.  I incorrectly assumed like most intelligent software, it would have adjusted the windows firewall to suit it's needs, but apparently not.  I could've just poked a hole for just the app, or the port, manually, but since it's an internal only network, I simply disabled the firewall altogether.  And as soon as I did that, both started working.  I wish there was an option to select your own 4 digit code but they only allow you to ""change"" it and it preselects a ""random"" code.

First I tried the streaming.  I have 21 terabytes of digital media on a Windows Home Server in my basement - and I've tried the Air Video app off and on for somewhere near two years, and have always had issues with it.  So I was curious to try this out.  I let it take the default media locations since I already had my music, videos, and photos redirected to the server locations anyway.  And it worked.  Just that simple.  Picked videos, selected the home network as the source, and there they were.  The on-the-fly transcoding worked flawlessly.  Whether it was my MKV files, my 9 year old's AVI and MP4 cartoons, they all worked great.  Short startup time, and once they were going, no skipping or pauses.  Far better than I had with Air Video.

Then I tried the remote control IOS software, and loved it.  What I didn't know is there's even a touchpad option that turns the touch screen into a trackpad.  Which was handy since when I fired off a movie for the first time I got a few popup boxes that needed me to check things off and hit YES or NO.  Did the job.  There is even a text entry part of it.  For actual DVD playback, it has all the transport controls and even the red / yellow / blue / green buttons and such.  Response is not quite instant, but considering network latency, it's as close as it could be - fraction of a second for my press to be acted upon in the media center.

My 3D discs worked without any issues as well.

I only have a 2.1 sound bar, so I can't attest to the 7.1.

I don't know what is different for me than for so many of the people in here who gave it 1 or 2 stars...  There was a recent update, and I didn't check the dates on the reviews but it's possible the update fixed some issues so I never had to deal with them.  Or it may just be something with my hardware that it works well with.  Regardless of the reason, it's working perfectly for me, and I'm very glad I purchased it.  This was the last piece of the puzzle I was missing for my Media Center upgrade to Windows 8, and it does everything I needed and a few things I didn't know I'd bother with that are already indispensable."

0,"I have to admit that I come into this with a bit of bias, I have been a Mac user for over 20 years.  Now that Macs are able to run Windows on the same hardware I thought I would be worth it to give it a shot.

I can't say if this is an improvement as compared to previous versions of Windows, but what I can say is that from the short time I spent with this OS I would not be inclined to switch to Vista as my main operating system.  It has nice graphics and was not at all terribly difficult to install but it just isn't doing for me.

1,Always used Turbo Tax and now I bought H&R Block.  It is great and I like it better than Turbo tax.
1,Nice product.
-0.5,"I have used several versions of streets and trips in the past and have always felt it was a decent product and worked well enough, but had room for lots of improvements.  This was back in the day when only a select few had internet on their phones and Google didn't even have maps (mainstream at least, definitely not satellite views).  I had high hopes for Mappoint where it is supposed to be for ""business"" and I suppose it does have some nice features like being able to create sales territories or zones and such, but aside from that and a few other features, it is almost identical to streets and trips.  Granted, I have not used most of the ""collaborative"" or ""analysis"" functions, but I still can not see justifying the cost.  I'm not going to go into detail here (because several other reviewers already illustrated my same thoughts) but my main complaints are still the following:

- Poor search bar integration and results (i get much better results using google maps and typing in the search term while viewing the area I want to search, in MP and S&T I get results all over the US and Canada).  There were some instances where it simply could not find addresses.
- Poor quality maps (google and bing offers better rendered maps and SATELLITE (they could at least offer that option to view when you have an internet connection, but instead, they have a toolbar button that links to Bing)
- Inability to create list in MP and export out
- Could not figure out how to multi level sort and filter imported database

While I'm sure MP has its uses, I do not see it being that useful a tool in my business (I am not in Sales and Marketing).  So like another reviewer said, download the trial first to see if it does what you want before you commit yourself to the $250+ to own it.

My last thought is that if S&T is similar (which I can' t see why it wouldn't be), even at it's lower price, I think it needs serious updates especially in this age where wireless modems, tethered phones, and standalone GPS devices are getting cheaper and more capable."
-1,"We have been Turbo Tax users for many years now. Even when I had a small business and needed an accountant, I still used Turbo Tax to get a good idea as to what our tax liability would be.  Every single year, I was within a couple of dollars of our accountant.  Turbo Tax is a trusted brand in our house.

Highlights:

~ Easy to Use! User Friendly!  Let Turbo Tax guide you and ask the questions!
~ Accurate
~ Easy transfer of data from previous years!
~ Includes 5 free e-files, so you can get the kids taxes done too! (Please Note:  It does not include State)

  I have never understood why people pay companies to ""do their taxes"".  Turbo Tax is an economical and easy solution. It has the most up to date tax law and will continue updating for you!  Turbo Tax double checks your return and guarantees 100% accurate calculations!

  Most people dread filing their taxes! Not here! Not with Turbo Tax. It is just so easy....Turbo Tax will put all your numbers in the right place on each form! You can check it at the end, e-file and safe a copy!

UPDATE:  When I first posted the review, I had done a quick review of our taxes and tested the software.  I wasn't ready to purchase the additional State software at the time, but assumed it would be flawless like in the past.  Wrong.  I was unable to complete the purchase for the State. It took me in an endless loop to add credit card information again and again.  I kept getting a message to ""try again or go to support"".

In addition,  I found two quirky tax situations that Turbo Tax is NOT able to handle. You have to manually go in and enter the information. This is in regards to a Long Term Disability Repayment for prior years.  Even with the prior years Turbo Tax files on my computer, it was unable to compute.

I contacted Intuit regarding another quirk - this is also in regards to a disability repayment. Turbo Tax shows an inflated income due to a repayment of LTD when SSDI kicks in. Due to that ""inflated on paper"" income, it makes your Premium Tax Credit (Marketplace Health Insurance) look as though you owe them back a portion of the money! Intuit promised me a return phone call that same day.  It has now been four days and I haven't heard from anyone.

To avoid further delay, my husband went out and purchased the Deluxe version with the State included. I had to remove this version from my computer.  The two quirks above still have not been addressed. I will enter the number manually as I have been told. As for the repayment of Premium Tax Credit....I guess we just have to wait to see how and if that is ever resolved."
0.5,"Havent used WINZIP in a while, so I thought Id try the newest version WinZip 18 and checkout the Pro extras. Was easy to load on my computer. Worked well compressing document files, also was easy to convert files to PDF . Extremely useful doing all this with one software. Unzipping compressed files was quick and complete. Take a lot of photos and the resize function was easy to comprehend and utilize in uploading to social media. Find the cloud access makes it simple to store and very helpful in sharing files. I find this upgraded WinZip version easy to use and truly useful tool."
1,TurboTax is the best. I've tried others but this is so much easier to navigate.
1,"I really did not know what I was going to get with Hassle Free packaging, but it was actually okay to not have a box to put in recycling.  The product and its activation key come in a straightforward and easy to open oversized CD poster board thickness CD jacket.  The face of the CD says Homeowner and Investor now.

I have used H&R tax software since before the company used it and it was called Tax Cut.  I have always been happy with it but I have so many years of experience I prefer not to use the interview method of form completion for everything.  Having error and consistency checks is useful..  It is also good to have some forewarning if deductions might prompt an audit, although in the end you still need to put down the correct information even if it means dealing with the IRS later to defend what is claimed.

I would go back to doing my tax returns entirely by hand and calculator before spending the much higher price that Turbo Tax demands, but the convenience of avoiding careless mistakes, especially in math, make this software worth using.  If you also need to file a non-trivial state income tax form just be sure to buy a version that includes the state tax form.  I have no need for that though.  My state has no state income tax and my previous state had just simple modifications of what is on the 1040 to make that would not have justified paying even $1 more to get the state form."
0.5,"If you are looking at using Ancestry dot com, then the 6 month included membership makes the Family Tree Maker software free as long as you don't want access to international records. The problem for me is that nearly EVERYONE comes from somewhere outside of the US at some point but those records are not part of the 6 month membership nor can you upgrade to those without paying a lot more.

To be even more clear, if this software came with a 6 month international membership (even if it was 50 percent more to reflect this addition) I would give it 5 stars. But while the software is great and sold, it is not worth the big price tag without the membership and the membership is limited because it is US only.

The software works like you would expect and never crashed on me. The value is decent if you need US only records but understand the included membership starts the day you install the software so wait to install it until you are ready to spend the time to fully use the service to get the most bang for your buck."
1,"I have been using Norton Security for many years and am happy with this years upgrade.  It was painless to upgrade the 8 devices use this on.
Using Norton gives me confidence that I am as protected as one can be."
-1,"It was not a disk. When I tried to get the upload from the Norton site, all I got was crap about buying more stuff. I have used Norton for a long time but I bought another brand this time."
1,"I just started using this about a week ago.  I have gone through the first disk (I had a lot of third-year Spanish courses in college.) This is version 9.  According to the TellMeMore website, the latest version is Version 10, which is a completed rewrite.  They sell 10 Levels Version 10 for $549 and this one for $374.  They have an on-line demo.

I majored in German and also studied a lot of Spanish, so I am familiar with the various teaching methods.  Their method is a good mix, since it works on all six main areas of language: reading, writing, speaking, aural comprehension, grammar and vocabulary.

Actual news broadcasts is a particularly useful approach, since ALL language-learning programs basically use highly-scripted text.

They also have a 10+2 level package where the final two lessons are business-specific vocabulary.

The user interface could use some improvement.  It took several hours for me to stumble on how to do the crosswords and Audio Comprehension questions.  For crosswords, after you type in a word you have to click the ""solution"" icon, a lightbulb in the upper right corner.  It then gives you the next word. Normal reaction is that you would only click the solution icon if you just don't have a clue and NEED the answer rather than HAVE the answer. For the Audio Comprehension questions, after you select the answer you also have to click the solution icon so the progress report will show you have completed that task.

There is one incredibly annoying thing with the crosswords ... the program distinguishes between accented and unaccented words that have the exact same pronunciation.  So, for instance, if you type l instead of el or t instead of tu (or vice versa) it considers it an error. They don't say ""el -- article"" or ""l - pronoun"".  You just have to guess!

I DID NOTICE ONE SIGNIFICANT ERROR -- THEY GOT THE ALPHABET WRONG! Spanish has four letters that don't exist in English: ch, ll,  and rr.  For instance, chico has four letters, not five.  They don't list the ch or ll letters. As you go in further they eventually provide a LIST of the 29 letters. [Should be 30.  I originally said there were 3 extra letters and recently noticed the error.  I haven't used the program in awhile, so I don't know whether it shows 29 or 30.] But, by that time you are already used to thinking ""say -- ache -- ee -- say -- o"" (Chico) instead of ""chay -- ache -- say -- o"").  Also, you can't input the extra letters, which reinforces the error.  (They DO have clickable options for accented vowels and .)

The ""practice a phoneme"" drills do have animated graphics giving a basic idea of placement of the tongue, etc.  However, they use technical terminology only someone with linguistics training would know.  (Where is the alveolar ridge?)  Also, at least the diagram for t is wrong.  It describes an English t, where the tongue does not touch the teeth.  A Spanish t is a dental sound, meaning the tongue touches the back of the top teeth.

In the written portions, the program does distinguish non-English characters such as , ,  and  to force proper spelling but does not accept such characters from the United States-International keyboard layout.  Therefore, every time you have to input such a character you have to pick it from a chart with the mouse instead of just inputting it from the keyboard with right-alt plus the letter.

The program is also mouse-intensive. When you finish a question you can't just press Tab or Enter to move to the next screen, you have to go to the upper right hand and click the Next button.  Doesn't sound like a big deal, but it does quickly become annoying.

From what I have seen so far, having worked through the first disk, this is really not a program for someone who just wants to learn a little Spanish for vacation travel. It puts quite a bit of emphasis on proper word order, spelling (including proper letter accents), and even punctuation.

Because of the way lessons are broken down, you can repeatedly access a particular section and get repeated variations.

There are a few simple things it should mention early on that would make learning spelling and pronunciation much easier for beginners.  For instance, it could mention that Spanish is almost 100% phonetic. Also, that the voice accent goes on the final syllable but on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable if the word ends in a vowel or n or s, and in ANY multi-syllable word that does not follow that pattern you have to write an accent, e.g., seis but diecisis; nmero; sbado.  Also that pronouns get accents and adjectives/articles don't: he = l, you = t, but el = the and tu = your.  Also that question words get accents and non-question adverbs (etc.) don't: Where are you = dnde? but I know where = donde, How are you = cmo? but this s LIKE that"" = como, etc.

Judging from the demo, this program is EXTREMELY customizable.  There are six major categories and you can select which ones you want, ratios, etc.  For instance, if you are primarily interested in being able to read you could set it to emphasize that rather than speaking and aural comprehension. Judging from descriptions from professional reviewers, Tell Me More seems to be the ""Rolls Royce"" of language-learning programs.  Although I have only been using it a short while and am just starting to get a good idea of the features, I think I would agree.  (My undergrad major was languages and linguistics, I spent a year in a Ph. D. program in linguistics and German, and I have studied German, Yiddish, Spanish, French, Russian, biblical Hebrew, Latin, and English linguistics and I have about 90 semester hours in various foreign language courses at the post-secondary school level.)

Although this seems pretty expensive, 2009-2010 tuition for just one 3-semester hour course at Houston Community College, for example, for a Texas resident living outside Houston is $338 plus fees, etc. And beyond second year, college language courses focus on literature, so you don't learn a lot of words you would need in everyday use.

The Nuance voice recognition is VERY good and doesn't require ""training"" the program. It can pick up the difference, for instance, between aspirated (the puff of breath with English initial p) and unaspirated p and dental (Spanish) versus (English) alveolar t.  When practicing sentences, it will point out the particular word that needs to be practiced.

An important point regarding voice-recognition sentence practice: It expects you to pronounce each word separately. Even if you pronounce them clearly, if you run words together it considers it wrong.  (Actually, American news anchors, actors, etc., say each word separately, but most people don't realize it.)

As you get more advanced, the program provides an increasing variety of activities. So far I have found it very good and still interesting, even though I am going over basic introductory material."
-1,"VERMONTERS DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE. Tax Software is suppose to help you complete your taxes accurately. How can you complete your taxes when they don't have all the forms you need? H&R Block does not have the forms necessary to file for a homestead in Vermont and they refuse to correct the problem even after they have been made aware of it. This is a basic form that all Vermonters should file if they owner their home and claim Vermont as their primary residence. I recommend Turbo Tax or Tax Hawk, I have used both in the past and both have the proper forms to declare a homestead. One star is too good a rating for this software."
0,"My first foray into digital video editing on a PC still makes me itch these many years later. One of our kids needed to do rough edits for a group project that had been filmed using a Sony that recorded onto optical disks, and when the group members could not get the proprietary editor to work, they asked me for help. That experience ended in a quick purchase of iLife and the short-term disappearance of my laptop.

For the past several years, I have needed to capture video and create digital ""movies"" ranging from 15 to 70 minutes in duration, complete with titles, themes, edits, wipes, and textual overlays. I tend to have to generate these in pressure-cooker clusters, with very little time between taping and final output. Because my primary equipment is Mac, I have become familiar with generating these ""movies"" using iMovie and then reducing the size of the resulting files with Handbrake. At the time I began testing Corel VideoStudio, I was running iMovie '08 and was wishing for a more powerful video editor. Based on Corel's literature, I anticipated the tools and effects to be more robust and diverse than iMovie. In addition, I dislike surrendering my computer while iMovie processes my edited files, which can take over an hour per file for larger files; using the family desktop would be a way to free my laptop of file-processing or a way to run two different edits at a time.

Other reviewers have noted the consumption of time and drive space required at setup; these were something I budgeted for and thus not a hindrance to my use or impression of the program. What I did find to be a drawback was the lack of intuitiveness/obviousness of the editing process, even after practice and acclimatization. For context, I calibrated my expectation of the process to be similar between this product and what it was like to learn Photoshop in the pre-Elements era.

With practice, I was able to generate output that met my needs and that was richer in nature than my iMovie files. However, the interface was not as intuitive as I needed it to be, which makes using Corel VideoStudio a bit of a slog. And on each occasion when I have returned to it after an absence of several weeks, several of the steps just did not come naturally to me, which I consider to be a negative."
0,"I would avoid this edition, just like I avoided Vista; these are poor quality programs.

You need to ask yourself what your goals are with this edition of office before you buy it.  Are you a business professional who has been using office products for a long time and are used to the office 2000-2003 interface, need a lot of control over each program?  Then avoid this edition like the plague.  It boils down the user interface into a child's game of pictures and symbols that is useless for a professional in order to access, understand what they are accessing, what they need to get the task done.  If this is you, expect a VERY steep learning curve over previous versions (this is how Microsoft makes money, on training courses for new programs that are switched around for no reason other than to prop up this segment of their business).

If you are new to MS office and only expect to use it for basics like typing in word, simple calculations in Excel, and simple presentations in powerpoint, then go for it.  It'll be easy for you to use, and you won't be so frustrated at finding specific and powerful tools in each program.

Overall, a poor couple of years for Microsoft products. Let's hope the next windows and office isn't a dud."
0,"I installed the Rosetta Stone software on my Vista based laptop with no problems. It uses the same core software for all of the languages. After installing the core software, I then installed the lanugage software for all three lessons in Japansese, as well as 3 in another language.

The software comes with it's own headset and microphone combination. It worked correctly with no installation problems. Before each lesson begins the software asks you to repeat a phrase to correctly set the microphone level. The headset and microphone worked very well in a variety of envirnonments around my office and home, but I did not test it in loud environments like an airport.

It is hard to describe exactly how the software works, but it essentially focuses on visual assocations which are much more natural than a textbook or classroom based approach. As the lessons progressed I was surprised at how quickly I could understanding more complex (compound speech) language.

The software records your progress including the rate at which you pass testing along the way. It was so natural, that after I finished a set of language I found myself beginning to immediately think of the language in the real world around me. So I found it to be immediately helpful.

I've tried to learn two languages in a classroom environment, but never succesfully. While I cannot say that I've learned Japanese yet, this is clearly a great start and introduction. I'll update my review when I finished lessons 2 and 3."

0.5,"I bought Parallels for Mac because of previous problems with other similar program, VM Ware.  In all fairness, the VM product was a beta so I should have guessed it would be buggy, but even the non beta version had its fair share of bugs.

Although VM Ware loaded XP home without a hitch, using the program was fraught with difficulties.  First, it was slow as molasses in January.  I'm not taking just a little slow, I'm talking 'go to lunch and maybe it'll be finished' slow.

Secondly, it was prone to mouse failure.  Although it would recognize my mouse, it was always at least 2 inches off the mark.  If I wanted to click a box I finally learned to position my mouse at least 2 inches below the intended button and then click.

Finally, VM Ware allows for the import of an existing Boot Camp partition (see below) but the process is slow and one slight misstep spells doom.  For the novice, it's intimidating.

Then I went to Boot Camp, which is Apple's built in Windows capable utility.  It worked without a hitch but you had to reboot to either OS X or Windows and hold the option key to get a boot menu.  Of note, Boot Camp runs Windows natively, that is, at the same speed as a regular Windows machine.  Fact is, it runs quicker on a Mac!  All you have to do is go to the Boot Camp utility (under Utilities in the HD icon) and it walks you through it.

I got Parallels because I was tired of rebooting my computer to get to Windows.  I use Quicken 2008 quite a bit and Quicken for Mac really bites so I do have to use Windows.  With Parallels I don't have to reboot.

How difficult is it to access the Boot Camp partition with Parallels?  Well for starters, it takes about as long as reading this sentence.  Once you install Windows into Boot Camp you then install Parallels in Mac.  Upon opening Parallels the first time it'll ask you if you want to import the Boot Camp partition with Windows on it.  Click yes and you'll get a desktop icon that states 'My Boot Camp'.  After a few minutes of tweaking you'll have Windows running on your Mac desktop.

Of course, it's not all fun and games.  For example, you'll get a warning that your Windows serial number is no longer any good because of significant hardware changes on your computer.  Not a problem.  I called the Microsoft toll free number and they issued me a new serial number when I told them what happened.  Also, until Parallels recognizes and installs your mouse in the window, you'll have to revert to the old ALT routine (the underlined Y in Yes means you have to press the Y key to enter the command.  Making things weird is that you sometimes have to hit the ALT or CTRL key, sometimes you don't.  Go figure).

Also, you must learn to read instructions.  Your mouse cursor will be stuck in the Parallels window that appears.  It will seem you can't get it out of the box.  Read the bottom of the box and it'll tell you to hit CTRL and ALT to get the cursor out of the box and back to Mac.  It you go to full screen mode, you'll have to remember to key in ALT and ENTER to access the Mac screen again (it merely minimizes the window that has XP or Vista in it).

By the way, the default memory allocated to Parallels is 512 MB.  Some may find this a tick slow and you can increase it to half of your available RAM if you desire (I have 4 GB so I could go to 2).  I found 512 to be just about right, but Vista will require at least 1 GB.

If done properly, Windows will act just as fast in Parallels on Mac as it does in Boot Camp.  I could detect no discernible difference, but there are a couple things to remember:

1. If Windows is open in Parallels, shut it down as you would any Windows machine.  Shutting it down by closing the window may make it crash.
2. Maximize the window for best performance.  If you use the default window size things get really crowded very quickly.
3. Don't think you can get away using a hacked or cloned version of Windows.  Parallels demands a serial number before it will load Windows, unless you import it from Boot Camp and then Windows asks for a serial number.  Either way, you're out of luck if you attempt to use a fraudulent copy.

For the price I paid (about $20 when I bought my Mac) you really can't lose with Parallels.  It works as intended and actually runs Windows better than a Windows machine."
0.5,"The greatest strength of ""Norton Internet Security 2002"" lies not in its capabilities, but in its reasonable price. The well-integrated components (i.e: AntiVirus, Personal Firewall, Privacy Control, and Parental Control) combine to make an attractive one-pack bargain. They work fine too! Indeed, you will observe some flaws in the software, but forgive Norton, and take solace in the fact that (unlike Microsoft) Norton doesn't make your wallet bleed before you can acquire her products."
0,"It would have been five stars if it weren't for infecting my test PC with OneDrive. It was a nice clean Win 7 machine and (rant on) I was pleased to not have to put up with one drive, the microsoft store, or all those ""features"" that assume I want my work machines to play music and games, download ""highly rated"" apps, and all that other sperg that gets in the way of actually trying to accomplish something meaningful (rant off). That said, the only unwanted install from office 2016 appears to be one drive. This will not be a factor for people installing onto Windows 10 machines because those come pre-infected.

First a confession - I've been transitioning my WIndows machines to LibreOffice because LibreOffice appears more secure. It doesn't phone home to provide ""usage statistics,"" and most importantly it doesn't run macros such as those exploited by that ransomeware that encrypts all your files. The further you are from those macros and from any autoplay functions, the safer you are.

But... I got a chance at a review copy of Office 2016 and decided to test out a few things. The install was easy. I had to enter the product code twice though - once before creating a new MS account and once after. Odd, but it only wasted a minute. Now, those tests...

First - can it be run without ever signing into a ""Microsoft account""? I don't want to log onto Microsoft's servers or risk unintentional uploads when I'm working on confidential documents, for example, documents subject to an NDA (non-disclosure agreement). No, you do need to create (or have) a ""microsoft account"" to install the software. This isn't particularly egregious because most commercial software requires such an account. It's just part of the registration process these days. Also, the account name is an email address and that address can be -any- email address. It doesn't have to be a hotmail account or anything like that but it does have to be valid because the registration process includes you verifying the address.

Second - can I run office 2016 without being logged onto a microsoft account? Yes. I edited files after restarting the computer and without signing into that MS account. I ran these tests on a Win7 machine but believe I can do the same with a windows 10 machine having a properly installed local account.

Third - can I run office 2016 offline? Yes. I disconnected the machine from the internet and restarted it. There were no issues creating and editing documents.

I did not test moving the license from one machine to another. I've done that with office 2013 and believe that it won't be that much of a hassle.

As for office 2016 itself. It's office - a package I've used in various forms for over twenty years. It does most everything I need and the menus and stuff are pretty much where they are in office 2013. That's what is most important to me - my productivity after installing new software. To be honest, for my usage this version is the same as office 2013 because I'm running 2013 on a windows 10 machine on which I suffer OneDrive and a plethora of other annoyances as well.

Now - what is up with my OneDrive disgust? It's that I need many gigs of -secure- storage. For cloud storage, there are HIPAA compliant providers who don't weasel strange crapware onto my computer. Some of those providers piggyback off of Amazon's wondrous cloud (AWS - amazon web services is a wonder to behold). I really want the ability to uninstall OneDrive (and many other odious bits) from my work machines just for security from malware exploiting stuff I never wanted anyway."
1,Works well as always. Thanks
0,"I've used too many anti-virus and anti-spyware applications over the years. Bitdefender is another in a long line of programs that get the job done, but simply aren't worth the extra money after the end of 2009. First, let me make it clear that Bitdefender does everything they claim it will do. It does an excellent job identifying and isolating risks to your PC. In that sense, Bitdefender is great and worth buying.

Unfortunately for Bitdefender, Microsoft finally figured out that they need to do something about Windows security. Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is now available for free download from the Microsoft website and is better than Bitdefender in a number of ways:

1) MSE is free.
2) MSE doesn't hog PC resources ... so your computer doesn't slow down because of the anti-virus software.
3) MSE is easier to manage because it integrates well with Windows.

Bitdefender identified all of the test viruses and adware I intentionally tried to expose my PC to, but why pay money for software if there is something else that does essentially the same thing for free? One advantage that Bitdefender has over MSE is that Bitdefender runs a full system scan faster than MSE, but Bitdefender also consumes more system resources ... so your computer slows down when Bitdefender is running a full scan.

Bottom line, there's nothing wrong with this software but I just can't recommend it now that Microsoft Security Essentials is available."
1,I have been using this for two weeks and have encountered no problems.  The only difference I have noted from 2015 is the length of time for updating takes a little longer. I just go get a cup of coffee.
0.5,"So far I have been using Trend Titanium for a couple of months.  Since I have started using it, I have not seen any major problems with any of the 3 computers in my house.  Even my mother-in-laws computer has been running fine and that is no easy task keeping it running good.  My problem with the product is that it noticably slowed my computer down.  Since I only use it for personal use, it doesn't matter much, but if I were using this product at work, it could cause me to fall behind in my work.
All in all, it is a good product.  I had no problems installing it, no problems figuring out how to use it, and so far, no problems with bugs in my computer."
1,Norton has always been the best and always will be in my opinion.  It was very easy to download this on my laptop and get it working. I haven't put it on my phone yet so that should be interesting. Will update my review once I have a chance to try it on my phone.

1,"I'm new to Painter and have had a bit of a go learning it enough to review the program. It's worth it. While the software is close to Photoshop in complexity it is also comparable in what it can do, which is an amazing amount. I've been sketching for a few years and that's what I tried first. Since I have a medium sized Wacom pad it's easy to draw with the program. It can emulate just about any artist media around including: pencil, charcoal, oil and water paints, and pastels. That's all I've tried. All work beautifully. I think that I've become a fan of Painter and look to be spending quite a bit more time with it."

-0.5,"I've been using Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 and I am not too enthusiastic about it. It does have some added value over online mapping solutions. However, it also has a lot of issues and in the end it is not a product I would pay for.

It is easier to create detailed multi stop routes using Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 than using online mapping solutions. I especially like the ""Find Nearby Places"" feature. The Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 application also has a lot more options and settings and it is easier to personalize. It is nice that you can work off-line and save your plans as a document, reload the file, update the route, save again, etc.

You are also supposed to be able to download your routes to your GPS device. This would be a nice feature if it worked. However, I have never gotten this to work. I have no problem downloading maps and other features to my GPS devices from, for example, the Garmin web site and other sites. However, I get ""device not detected"" no matter which Garmin GPS I use, and no matter which USB port I use, and no matter which computer I use, despite the fact that all USB ports work and my Garmin devices have no problem communicating with other sites.

The Help does not contain anything helpful, and none of the on-line information I found was helpful. I tried a number of things that did not work. Microsoft thinks it is the vendor who should inform you whether the GPS device is compatible with Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 and the vendor nearly dies laughing when he hears that. Basically, customer support does not exist and you won't get any help, and it simply does not work. Well, I know that some lucky people get this to work but from reading forums I know this is a common unresolved issue.

Anyway, other things I do not like is that Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 is notorious for freezing up and the route path on the map is way too thick and ugly and I did not find a setting to change it. I also don't think the maps look that nice. Between the online mapping solutions (Google maps, MapQuest, Bing, etc) and my GPS devices Microsoft Street and Trips 2011 adds very little value and with the issues I don't think this product is worth its price. That's my two cents."
1,This product is an excellent - low cost for great product.  We have used it many times on numerous jobs & recommend it highly.
0,"We absolutely hated what Microsoft did with office 2007.  The learning curve was so high and even today... still hate it.  Then Office 2010 came out and it was a step in the right direction but again, still hard to find things.  Whomever their experts are that says that the RIBBONS are awesome... must have been power users and not the average person.  Now we have Office 2013 and Office 365 which are basically the same thing, minor differences.

Office 2013 is yours.  You own it.  There are no additional fee's beyond the initial cost of the software.  There is one thing though, which was just pointed out to me (The reason i'm editing this review.)  Office 2013 Retail... is not really retail at all.  It's really OEM.  What that means is... you can only install Office 2013 on 1 pc/laptop and that's it.  Period.  End of discussion.

The reason that's important is because Office 2013 is licensed not to YOU the buyer... but to the PC it's installed upon.  So, if you ever sell that PC or scrap it for a new one... the copy of office goes with it.  You cannot uninstall from that machine and then install/transfer the license to another machine.  If your computer/laptop crashes and you have to put in a new hard drive and then restore from backup/reinstall everything, technically this is now a new machine as the Hard Drive has changed.  It's not the original pc anymore and therefor your copy of Office 2013 may not work any longer because it will detect that there was a change and the license specifically states that it's licensed to the original computer...  (so, if your pc changes, it's not original and goodbye office 2013).

This is huge... because Microsoft Office 2013 is very expensive... and now thanks to Microsoft... they are totally ripping off their customers.

So your choice is this... you buy 1 full retail version of Office 2013 for big huge bucks... you install it and then that's it... when that PC crashes or is retired for a new one, tough.  You will have to buy a new copy of MS Office all over again.  OR.... you can buy Office 365 but make sure you keep reading below about it's drawbacks with the primary one being... Office 365 is subscription based... if you don't pay EVERY YEAR... it will stop working and then what do you do?  (and... trying to keep the checks and balances... what happens when Microsoft starts goosing the renewal prices up every year, just like your landlord does?)

Office 365 is a rental.  Every year you have to pay to use it.  The benefit here is that you can install on up to 5 computers/laptops (vs. the boxed which goes on only 1 machine) and the benefit is that any time there is an office update (like when 2015 comes out) you automatically get the updates on all of your pc's.  So you're always using the latest and greatest.  Plus, 5 machine is only $20/machine.

So there are pro's and con's to each.  The thought of RENTING software I hate.  I try very hard that when it comes to software purchases, I go with lifetime subscriptions.  Office 365 is literally ""renting"".  Every year you must renew your license or it expires and you're left in the cold.  All of your office programs will eventually just stop working.

Anyhow, I like Office 2013.  I love Outlook in particular.  I see there's a few bugs, but that's ok.  They are minor and this software is what, a month old?  I like how you can reply from the preview pane, I like the layout and I like how I can customize things better.  I also like word much better than previous versions.  I'm still working out the menu's/ribbons because I freaking hate the RIBBON that Microsoft keeps telling me how great it really isn't.  :)

That all said you need to go read on the difference between the retail box and the 365 subscription.  Regardless of which way you go... I can say that for the first time in a long time, I'm much happier with the Microsoft Office product as a whole.

As you will see with comments about my original review... even I did not do as much reading as I should have... for I totally missed the part about the full retail Office 2013 being licensed to the PC and not the individual and therefore, if the PC crashes or simply gets to old... then too bad.  You buy another Office License.

For this reason I now downgrade this to 3 stars from 4."
0.5,Not much to say - it is tax software.
-0.5,"...unless you just must have the latest version. But without an upgrade-path pricing option, not sure this is worth the cost of full retail pricing.

Download time will depend on how long it takes your broadband provider to deliver the 665 MB executable. This is the only variable out of Microsoft's control. The things they could control don't add up to a compelling reason to upgrade from any earlier version of Office.

The interface is essentially the same tabbed interface from Office 2007 (that probably still stumps previous users of Office 2003 and earlier suites).

Installation on a desktop computer(4 GB RAM, 3GHZ Intel dual core processor) running Windows 7 Professional and with an existing Office 2003 Professional version already installed took about 20 minutes. Installation was trouble-free. While the document history entries in the Windows start menu were erased after the install, the recent documents history were available within each of the Office applications. I don't use Outlook for email at home, but do use it for calendaring. All of my existing entries were preserved and displayed immediately in Outlook; it also recognized my existing preference to start Outlook in the calendar view).

While the interface is familiar, application launch time is slightly faster, and there is improved feedback to users on recent files accessed in a navigation pane that appears under the File tab.

So, with a familiar interface, a problem-free install and apparent improvements in navigation and responsiveness...why 2 stars? Because the Office Professional suite is very expensive. The only reason I'm doing this review is because I had access to a deeply discounted purchase price via an educational licensing agreement. But if you are currently running an earlier version of Office, I can't offer a single compelling reason to sink anywhere from 220 dollars (for a product key to activate the trial versions on new PCs) to more than 400 dollars (for a version delivered on DVD).

If you have very basic productivity suite needs (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) you can consider the stripped down ""student version"" instead for much less...if your needs don't include Outlook, Access or Publisher. Alternatively, if you have an affiliation with an educational institution that has an academic licensing arrangement, you should have a access to a very reasonably priced Professional version.

Otherwise, unless you're just a ""current version junkie"" who enjoys having the latest and greatest version of every application, all, I can't offer a good case for spending this much on a set of tools that looks, feels and performs almost exactly like its predecessor."
1,Works as expected. Best AV on the market.
0.5,"I currently use Norton and it expires in a couple of months. I've used McAfee in the past and it seems as if its really trying to be competitive with this 2016 version of the Anti-Virus software.

There is no CD which I like. The last thing I need is another CD. Rather there is a card with a security key that allows you to download the software from the website. Of course, you'll need to create a McAfee account if you don't already have one.

Some of the features this software claims to have are:

Supports Windows 10, 8.1, 8 and 7
Windows - blocks viruses, malware, ransomware (this is a new one for me), spyware, unwanted programs, wi-fi protection, web safety, PC Optimization tools, anti-spam and parental controls and file protection

Mac & IOS = 10.8 or higher - anti-malware, firewall, network manager, web safety tools for MACs and anti-theft, file protection for iOS tablets and smartphones
True Key Identify Manager - Quickly and easily log in to sites, apps, and more using facial  recognition for up to 5 user accounts

Android devices - 4.0 and higher - Data backup, anti-theft, app privacy, and wi-fi protection for tablets and smart phones
Privacy Protection - Privacy, encrypt files stored on PCs

Free Support - Technical support, security advisers, and customer service available for the life of your subscription

Security Management Console - Check security status of all devices, remote location, lock and wipe your lost or stolen tablet or smart phone.

This is a 1-year subscription. A couple of red flags, one being that this product claims to protect all your devices, but only 5 User Accounts. My household has 3 PCS, 3 Laptops, 3 Tablets and 3 Cell phones. Also, this software claims to offer a lot and I can't properly review what it actually does until I actually install it in January, when my Norton subscription expires. One of the reasons I went from McAfee to Norton is because even though McAfee made some great claims, I was still affected by a virus, the apps associated with the virus are very intrusive especially on my Galaxy Note, that I had to uninstall it.

I will provide an update when I install this software. But it is important to remember that with the increasingly savvy techniques from hackers and other people who have nothing better to do than destroy your expensive computer equipment, that it is possible for any anti-virus software not to be 100% effective. It's also important to use common sense."

1,"This day and age  many people have a lot of different devices for recording video. I, myself have a number, including two cell phones, and ipod touch and ipad, several android devices (including a few Amazon Fire tablets), a dash-cam in my car, and a couple of the small action cameras. Not to mention some regular style camcorders and a digital point-and-shoot camera that can take videos. I was given a drone for Christmas that had a video camera  but it now lives in the top of a tree somewhere in a Louisiana bayou (story for another time). Plus, I'm slowly working on transferring old VHS tapes to digital format. So I was happy to try out this new version of Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 for the past thirty days. I've been using an older version of similar software from another brand (Corel VideoStudio Pro X3) and wanted to tryout something newer.

Installation was typical for a software package like this, and you need to activate the software and register it at the company's website (you'll need to set up an user account). The package also comes with a code that gets you some bonus content. I had problems with getting that. There really isn't any clear instructions as what to do with the code. I went out to the CATOON web site and couldn't figure out where to input the code. Doing a little research I finally figured out that you had to access the website through the web portal inside the software itself. Then I had the problem of how exactly to do that  the icon/button isn't marked very clearly (IMO). But I eventually found it (upper right-hand corner of the screen, black square with the letters CO and a blue dot inside the O). Since I had already set up an account with the Catoon store all I had to do is put in the code and check out. Make sure that the amount shown is $0.00 otherwise there was something wrong with the code. At first I was a  bit underwhelmed with the downloaded content, but after taking a better look at it  I changed my mind. You get three folders of stuff,  Videos, Songs, and Sound Fx. For the video, you get ten short abstract video pieces ranging from 5~27 seconds in length. You can use these for a variety of things. Songs, you get twenty pieces of music, and for Sound FX you get forty various generic sound effects. Not a whole lot of stuff, but some pieces that might come in handy. You can look around the Catoon store while you're there and check out some of the free stuff, but be aware  there is licensing on all the content there for the specific usage of the material. Be sure to first check to see what you're agreeing to before you use something you got for free.

The Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 was easy to jump in and get started using  but then I've had experience using similar video editing packages in the past. Someone new to video editing will probably be facing a pretty steep learning-curve trying to use this software for the first time. The company has provided a fairly detailed 400 page PDF user manual to read, but my suggestion is to go online and check out the video tutorials that are available on the companys website. These short videos are more a overview of someone demonstrating many of the software's features than actual tutorials  but you do learn something from viewing them. I first worked my way through the software by having one of the videos open on one of my screens and the software up on the other, and following along as the video played. This is probably a good place to mention something that sort of irked me about the tutorial videos. There are three different versions of this video editing software available (Pro, Pro Plus, and Pro Premium). The tutorials aren't very clear as to what features are in what package (well, they sort of do, I just didn't pick up on it). So after viewing the videos before I actually got the software, I was a bit disappointed that the Pro version didn't include some of the features that I was really wanting to try out (screen capture for instance). Still, go check out the videos if you're just starting to use this software for the first time, or are considering buying it.

The interface and actual operation of the software was similar enough to what I've used in the past that I was able to get started with no problems. Like I mentioned at the start of this review, I've got a number of video device (too many really). The issue with that is there are a couple different video file formats each of those produce. But the  Movie Edit Pro can handle all of those. I'm able to import and edit everything. Some of the features I like with this new editing package are  the title / subtitle feature. I make a lot of video sideshows for people using the photographs and I found that titling images is something that a lot of people appreciate. Having the ability to choose a location for the text and changing up the look of the font is really helpful. I also like that you can choose a stock menu when you burn a project to a DVD or  Bluray.

I also have Magix's Music Maker 2016 Live on my computer, and like that the music files made with it can be directly used for this video editing package. It's great to make a custom soundtrack for a slide show in Music Maker and then simply drop it into the audio track in Movie Edit.

I could probably go on and on about the things I like with this software, but that's enough. I have to say I really enjoyed checking this out and think it will be something I'm going to keep using for awhile. I'd recommend it to anyone needing to edit the videos that they too probably have piling up on their computers and devices.

Just in case it might be helpful - I'm running this software on a five year old computer  a HP HPE-190t desktop with an i7 processor and 12GB of ram running Windows 7 Pro. I've got two monitors, a 27 and a 24 which works well as I can set the main program up on the larger screen and use the smaller one for the video pre-view window."
1,I love it.
0,"I've used this program off-and-on, to convert photos to paintings, but I always end up going back to Photoshop. My impression is that maybe if you are a seasoned painter, or have previous experience with the program, it might be a good choice, but there's so many great tutorials and training DVDs on using Photoshop, that I end up going back to it. There's certainly so many things I would ONLY use Photoshop for as well, that I find it hard to recommend this, when I can achieve all I want with that program. I do see the potential here, and if you can get a copy relatively cheap, and are looking for a top notch program specifically for painting effects, it might be worth a look. For most users though, I'm not sure it's the best way to go."

0.5,"I have been a PowerDVD user for more than a decade. In the past I liked the interface, it was easy to navigate and was my first choice for an on-board DVD player for all of my PC's.  Cyberlink's PowerDVD 16 has a lot of nice features. I was able to access nearly all of the content I have on my PC - including some B roll footage shot on a Canon HFX Digtal video camera.  I was pleasantly surprised with ithis.

You can directly watch DVD's on your hard drive, access YouTube and even download.  What I did not like about this player is that it was not able to access all of my media files in the way that my other media player of choice, Media Monkey Gold is able to do.  I have to toggle between the two and that's fine.  I have yet to find a program that ""can do it all"" - but I keep hoping."
0,"I'd love to tell you what I think of this program, but I can't get it installed. The documentation is good, and it appears to have great features, but I don't know for sure. I'll update this review if I manage to get it to work."
1,"I have used TaxCut for at least 10 years.  This year's H&R Block version seems a smooth transition from the last couple years.  I have not done my taxes yet, so I have not encountered any problems.  If I do I will return and update this review.  I did notice in the reviews that some people had troubles in downloading the state edition (VA in my case).  I had no problem downloading and installing the VA program.  Since last year my computer got a virus which required me to erase everything and reload. All my data was backed up on a external drive.  However, I did want to look at my 2008 return on my computer so I reloaded the 2088 TaxCut and updated it with no problem.  Then I downloaded the VA state version for 2008 which went very smoothly.  So far everything is working fine.  Last year I did have a problem with the updates which required me to get tech support from H&R Block which worked very well.

As an aside, I worked for a year as an H&R Block tax preparer and was shocked to learn their program in the office was nothing like TaxCut.  It was very difficult to learn and to use.  Of course, it was very powerful, but a pain.  Even when I worked in the H&R Block office I continued using TaxCut for ours and our children & mother-in-law returns."
0.5,Works well !
1,Easy install process. It also will update your other versions. The best thing about this particular version is you get 3 uses. It's a huge advantage over the competition. So far it is doing a great job blocking spam from my mailboxes. The spam that my normal application ie. AOL misses gets kicked out by McAfee. I love it!  Get it.
0.5,"Video editing is not my cup of tea.  I typically avoid it, not because I don't understand it, but because I just don't have the time.  I want to shoot the video and watch it.  Unlike photo editing (which I love to do), video editing always seemed tedious.  Splicing together clips seems painful to me. Enter Corel VideoStudio Pro.  Now I am not going to say that this program changed my mind about editing, but I will say it made the task interesting.  From the beginning VideoStudio made it simple to organize, cut, and splice clips.  I found the tool intuitive and am willing to dive deeper into it's functions.  So if you are like me and don't like editing your video clips, try VideoStudio it might chenge your opinion of the whole process. Also, my kids love goofing arounf making funny movies from various clips (they are 8 & 12).  They were able to pick up on it with only a couple of lessons from me."

It is an inexpensive program that has more options than I will ever even used. In fact, I could not be much more impressed with that software (for my somewhat limited personal needs). Therefore, I thought this Pinnacle software would far surpass my wildest expectations ... it is much more expensive and seemingly has endless options that sounded exciting to explore. I was ready to start experimenting!

Well, the reality wasn't as rosy.

While the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photo-and-Video-Pro-Suite/dp/B008MR2GUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photo and Video Pro Suite</a>&nbsp;I was using never froze, this one froze on four (extremely) frustrating occasions. (After the first incident, I did close all other open programs). After the fourth, I elected to remove the software entirely and then ran CCleaner just as a precautionary measure. (There is something about this software that I simply do not like, and I felt more at peace by running the CCleaner ... even though I know that sounds extreme).

And, when I briefly had it working, in no way is it ""user-friendly."" What's more, I have used Pinnacle in previous years and I have never experienced comparable annoyance and problems. One wonders if they have become complacent (they have had success in the past) or if they failed to beta-test this  software. Nonetheless, this topic is  moot: I do not believe the average consumer will wonder what went wrong with Pinnacle, they will only know they are out over $100.00. And, in this economy, no one can afford to ""throw away"" $100.00.

As a final note, believe ALL of these posts about non-existent, gratis customer support. Who charges their customers when the flaw resides in their own product? The reps need to learn the difference between a person inept using the program and a person genuinely disappointed and in need of guidance for a program the company created."

0.5,"New Quicken for MAC-a must buy for MAC users.  I am a Quicken 2007 user so the new 2015 is great visually and editing and data manipulation is much easier since a MAC product using the latest OSX whistles.  Import from Q2007 data was flawless to the penny for my bank and credit card imports.  A few investment imports were off in the total transaction value due to roundoff or security price differences, BUT these were easily found.  And the number was less than 15 for over 1000 transactions between 2 accounts.  3 of my 5 investment accounts had no errors.

The only concerns are that some of my must have features (that are present in Q2007) are not yet in Q15 like calendar view of present and future transactions, as well as forecast graphs. Also the report module is not mature-there are some reports but the ability to edit the standard reports in Q2015 is limited.  The investment module has what most people need (e.g. portfolio view and transactions as well as capital gains calculations, to name a view that I use all the time) but the investment analysis is limited due to lack of some reports.  But Quicken promises many updates in the next 12 months at no cost and I have confidence they will update.  The potential list of improvements and the ability to vote is available on the Quicken product website (www.quicken.com/mac).

Overall happy with the product.  Program is stable and import module is fast and accurate AND better than I have experienced when transitioning from Quicken windows to Q2007 and from MS MYM to Quicken for windows

A recommend buy for MAC users.  The many features listed on the Amazon website is accurate and for added detail you can look on the Quicken/mac website.  It is a solid 4 stars and could be 5 when the updates promised are incorporated in the near future.

The only potential downside is that you must pay to try and the cost is a  higher than Quicken competitors, but having tried the two main competitors, I believe the cost and risk is justified. I certainly picked Q2015 over others.  Note that Quicken has a 60day return policy no questions asked"
1,"I received my adapter before the wireless router (also EnGenius) and setup an ad hoc connection. Windows 7 found the adapter right after I connected it to a usb port. It is a small but stylish adapter. I like everything about it. After that it was just a matter of using Windows 7 Network and Sharing Center to setup the connection.

Of course, once the router arrived, it was a snap to setup the network, since Windows 7 had no problems finding the adapter and router. To setup a network using a router, plug in the wireless adapter and then follow the instructions for setting up the router. Easy installation and use, and low price makes each EnGenius product an excellent value."
0,"I don't care too much for McAfee. It doesn't seem to find anything, although I must say it has stopped me from going on certain sights. But I think I will go with AVG next time. I love how AVG is good even the free version. That's why I gave this  3 stars because, AVG I think is one of the best out there. I have tried Norton which I really don't like, but AVG yes, that's the way to go. If I didn't pay for this I would delete it."
0,"I tried MS Streets & Trips on my Asus Netbook with 2 GB of ram during a recent road trip.  Installation of the software on the notebook went well, and I plugged the small GPS unit into a free USB port on my Asus put the netbook on the passenger seat and headed out.

The software interface feels dated; I wasn't entirely impressed with either the design or functionality.  Many functions weren't very intuitive, with multiple panes opening and closing providing different data.  Once I sorted it out and programmed my first trip in though, things got a bit easier.

The GPS unit picked up satellites quickly and easily, besting the GPS unit in my phone as well as a dedicated handheld Magellan unit I had brought for comparison.  My  trip progress was tracked accurately, with a readout of estimated mileage and ETA updated on the fly.  The major problem was finding things nearby.

With freestanding GPS units, it's easy to simply ask it to display nearby gas stations, hotels, etc.  However, there's no way to do this easily with S&T.  The only way to get that information is to go to the turn-by-turn list of directions, figure out which step you are near, select THAT, and then request nearby places of interest.  Not only wasn't it intuitive, it was useless to me: I used my G1 and its GPS unit for that functionality most of the time.  One other problem I had was a few software crashes. I was unable to determine if this was bad code or an underpowered netbook - though mine is easily able to run everything else I've thrown at it.

I suppose if you sat in a room and planned your trip, then loaded those trips as you traveled, this would work fine. Alternatively, if you had a navigator with you running the computer, you might be in ok shape, if not a bit puzzled at times by the interface.

But for use as a GPS on the fly while traveling solo, I'd give it a pass.  It just doesn't provide the ease of use or functionality I want in a GPS."

0.5,"Cyberlink PowerDirector 13 Ultimate is a powerful video editing program that can let you do a ton of really cool things, the biggest drawback is the learning curve it takes to get proficient with how the programs works and how to apply the various edits tricks and effect you want to use.

Installation is relatively simple, but lacks directions or instructions, you just get boxes that open up asking you which program you want to install, now I could figure out what order I want to do this in, but someone less experienced may get confused.  Installation was fairly quick, probably under a half hour for all of the programs on both discs.  Also once installed and running, the program recognized that it needed to download a free update to the software to apparently help things run smoother.

I consider myself a fairly smart guy and pretty tech savvy but this program just seem to take me a while to get used to. You don't get a lot of easily accessible instruction or help when working with this.  There is a help file and manual, but it isn't the easiest to navigate or find information in.  When you have a big new program like this it would be helpful to have maybe some training tutorials or walkthroughs that would help you cover the basics of the software.  It is nice that everything uses a similar interface to work with you just have to get used to that interface.

So I basically spent a weekend afternoon playing around and I was able to figure out the basics, there is a lot of built in effects and add-ons with this package.  The mains ones for me being a wedding package, which includes all type sof pree made titles, effects, etc for weddings, and a holiday package which similarly had all sorts of great stuff for holiday videos.

So in fact I used the program to make a nifty little holiday video for the office, it was only a few minutes long, and only took a few hours to make, like I said once I knew what I was doing, the software made things pretty easy.  The software made things look great, everything came out great in HD for a nice rendered web video and also burnt for hi-def on a blu-ray disc for posterity sake.

Overall this is a great program just be willing spend the time to experiment and figure out how everything works, do that and I think you will be happy."
1,An updated version of an older version for an older operating system working good
1,"Basic zip/unzip support (called ""compressed"" in Windows 7 and 8) is built into the newer version of Windows, so why buy a premium version? I decided to order this product to see how it compares. I find it to have a lot of features that many people will probably not need, to be simple to use, and to be valuable for those who want a bit more compression capabilities. For normal users I don't think it adds a lot of needed functionality.

The program installs  in either 32 or 64 bit versions (I tested the 64-bit version). Installation was no problem. The programs uses a ""ribbon"" style interface, like the newer Microsoft Office products; I found it to be very intuitive. It also integrates directly with the Windows Explorer (the file window used in Win 7 and 8), so that one can right click and access options for compressing/decompressing files. The program works by simple drag and drop to add files. Clicking on a zip file brings up the main program. I found the interface and program functionality to be fine.

For an additional 9.95 (each), one can add zip capabilities to SharePoint, Outlook, and Photos. I didn't try those features.

The only real problem I had is that I would have liked to use a command-line interface for backing up files. The program is advertised as having this; according to the documentation, the capability is available as an add-on, but there is no such add-on listed at the web page.

Summary: If you want to create smaller backups, encrypted or self-extracting zip files, or have a need to regularly zip files for professional use, this is a great choice. Highly recommended.

I've put in some additional information below if you are interested.
---------------------------------------------------------
Here are the program features that are NOT built in to Windows:

+ Capability of making self-extracting zip files. This means the person receiving the file can simply click on it to have it unzip itself. I think this is somewhat limited in utility, because most people receiving the file will be able to unzip it anyway via Windows.

+ Advanced levels of encryption. When turned on, the zip file will be protected by AES level encryption. Provided you use a strong password, it is much more secure.

+ Multiple capabilties of zip compression, varying from fast to maximum.

+ Simple integration with cloud drives. You can save directly to those drives and open from them.

+ Direct integration with social media, which allows one to upload directly - although most social media doesn't really use zipped files.

+ Integrated email capabilities (though most folks will use whatever email client they normally use).

+ Capability of resizing photos as they are zipped. This might be nice for those who are uploading to social media or other situations when a specific resize is needed.

+ Capability to convert all files to PDF as they are added to the zip archive. This is useful for professionals who always want to protect their distributed files from being (easily) modified.

+ Capability of adding a watermark to files as they are zipped. This would be very useful for professionals who are sharing samples of their work.

+ Capability of using the program to perform backups. There is a backup menu devoted to this function. This is useful for those with smaller external backup disks. Along these lines, the program allows for a ""split"" archive, and includes settings for the maximum DVD size - useful for making backups to DVD. There are provisions for only backing up files with the ""archive"" bit set, so it can be used for both full and incremental backups."
1,"I've been heavily into PC's since 1993 and have tried most of the major Security Product.  I've come to think Norton is the All Around Better on Average Security product you can buy.  They have Good Tech Support and if a new version comes out you get upgraded for free. I subscribe to 4 of the major PC magazines and most have a once a year review of the main Security Suites and the majority of the time Norton comes out either on top or very close to the top. Year after year.
Were talking overall averages of performance now and not one particular test within the tests that the reviewers do."
1,The real deal for a great price.
1,I used this to make calenders. I an going to give these as X-mas cards this year. It was Easy to use. I also used this for scrapbooking all my photos. This will save you time as well as money. The templates are great. You can also make cutouts  and embellished designs as well as spreadsheets . I admit it took me sometime to get it started but after 15 minutes I was able to do the layouts and pick out templates.
0.5,"About the time Windows Vista came out, I switched to Macs. For the most part, I never found myself wanting for software offerings unless it was (1) a game or (2) genealogy software. Sure, there was Mac software, but it just didn't appeal to me like FTM for PC did. When a version was finally released for the Mac a few years ago, I was ecstatic, only to be thoroughly disappointed when it turned out to be something like a port of a PC version from years before, and wouldn't even read the PC database file without a sketchy conversion process. Finally, with FTM 3, PC and Mac users are on more or less equal footing. Perhaps the most notable improvement, and the one which appeals to me most, is the fact that the database file is finally ""native"" for the Mac version. I was able to easily put my PC file on a flash drive and open it with FTM for Mac 3, make some changes, save, and then open it back up on my PC. In fact, I can now just store the file in my DropBox folder and open it on whichever computer I happen to be near. Though I really only have a PC for gaming, I can now comfortably abandon FTM for the PC secure in the knowledge that if something should ever happen and I need access to FTM on a PC, I don't have to jump through any hoops to make things work. I can e-mail the database file to relatives who have a PC without having to worry about losing data in a conversion (and they can send their PC files just as easily). It really is a game-changer for me, and I'm glad I've stuck with FTM long enough to finally see this development (though it should have come years earlier)."
0.5,"What I wanted to do: make multiple copies of a DVD containing old family Super 8 movies

What happened: the program installed easily, deleting some freebies along the way, all by itself. The instruction book isn't bad, but I felt like there was a distinct gap between part 1: copying the source DVD, and part 2: burning the new DVDs. I was able to reason it out myself, though, and I ended up saving the video file onto the hard drive and burning that as many times as I wanted.

I'm subtracting a star for this perceived gap, especially since this set really doesn't do much else besides copying and changing formats.

An interesting side effect has occurred, though; these ancient pictures need a bit of tagging with names, etc. in the form of subtitles. If anybody can suggest a way to do this that'll work with this program (and not cost pounds of flesh), I'd LOVE to hear it!! I SURE hope the video bug didn't bite me!! :D"
0.5,"Let's just get right to it:

PROS:
Plays Blu-ray Discs, 3D movies, and DVDs.
Plays other media from your computer.
Can display non-3D video and photos in 3D, though your mileage may vary.
Easy install.
Comes with a very nice pair of anaglyph 3D glasses.

CONS:
Bulky and bloated. Takes up a lot of space and loads slowly even on very fast PCs.
Retail version still has advertisement in the way of little pop-ups that ask you to upgrade.
Slow reaction when it comes to movie controls, sometimes.
Accessing additional controls (interlace, subtitles, color, etc.) is more complicated than other options.

THE DETAILS:
I use PowerDVD 12 for two things: When I want to watch a Blu-ray Disc on my computer, and when I want to watch a normal 2D movie or slideshow in 3D, using PowerDVD's pseudo-3D enhancement. The 3D enhancement really does work, though it is a bit inconsistent and you'll find some things in the background popping out, instead of things in the foreground. It's still a cool effect, and the glasses they include are rather nice for anaglyph 3D glasses; They're plastic, with real hinges on the temples, and of decent build quality.

But when it comes to video playback in 2D, unless it's a Blu-ray Disc, I still prefer to use VLC (VideoLAN) for my movie-watching needs. It's faster, easier to control, and doesn't pester me with pop-ups at startup asking me to look into other upgrades and features. VLC is also free, and gives fine control over the video color, quality, and features in the contextual menu-- Something PowerDVD 12 lacks. You can start the journey toward tweaking controls and appearance in PowerDVD 12's contextual menu, but that just takes you to a large pop-over menu that has limited features.

In short, PowerDVD 12 is made for people who just want to pop in a disc and have it play automatically without any tweaking or customizing. It's not made for people who like to customize their experience. That being said, it's still an excellent way to play Blu-ray Discs on your PC, and the 3D feature is kind of cool for those of us who haven't invested in a 3D HDTV yet.

PowerDVD is well worth having around if you enjoy Blu-ray Discs. If you're looking for something to play video files, photo slideshows, music, and DVDs, though, I'd recommend either VLC or J. River Media Center 16. Both manage these other tasks faster and more efficiently than PowerDVD does, currently, and do it without the nags, retail links, and resource hogging found in PowerDVD 12.

VERDICT:  The best Blu-ray Disc player for Windows, but ""average to slow"" for other tasks."

0,"Imagine a flu shot that made you feel sick for several days. On the one hand, you wouldn't get the flu, so you wouldn't get some of the really nasty complications that sometimes come with the flu. On the other hand, you'd still get about as sick as you would with a normal flu.

It's the same way with this virus program: It slows down your computer just like most of the trojan horses and spyware it prevents from being installed. However, it will prevent the rare occurrence of some really nasty viruses.

There are other, better options out there for viruses that are faster and less invasive. I have used the free version of AVG antivirus for several years, and my computer is fast and has never had a virus infection that I know of. Installing this program slowed things down."

0,"I was a bit disappointed in this product for two major reasons:

1) The amount of functionality you get from the different photo editing products does not equate to the amount of memory it takes to run the programs, and the amount of resources they use. If you are going to use this software only occasionally, then the impact will be minimal, but I would definitely not recommend this package for heavy use.

2) While some of the programs do perform functions that are rather unique to Corel, many of the functions can be found in less expensive software products (even free), so shop before you buy. Also, the graphic output files that these products produce are for the most-part proprietary to Corel. That is, the output files it creates are not in a standard format and cannot be later uploaded and used in other photo editing programs. This is a definite drawback.

On the plus side, there are functions that this software has that are fun and make great projects for families. When my grandchildren visit, the photo painting software gets a lot of use, and is a great, creative alternative to video games. My eldest grandchild has even created several calendars for herself! I also understand that the scrapbook software has some nice features, but, since I am not a scrapbooker, I suggest you study the other reviews for more information on those features."

There are also a couple of hiccups with moving back after you've done a search, but it's not something that would be frustrating to the point of not using it. The good definitely outweighs the bad, however. It's easy to install, makes it easy to access Ancestry from inside the program and gathers everything you need in an organized and intuitive platform. If you're looking into digging through your family history, I can definitely recommend Family Tree Maker as a tool to use in that process."

At the moment I have my desktop, printer/fax/copier/scanner, laptop and one Panasonic network security camera connected to this router, all wireless, and they all work very reliably.

1,"I really like this new version of Microsoft Office.  Like previous upgrades, there isn't too much of a difference in Excel and Word other than a few things, it is Outlook which has the largest improvements.  I really like the new look as it uses ""screen real-estate"" much more efficiently.  The Junk E-Mail filters are better than in previous editions (much better!) and I had no problems working with my previous PST files.  Also, the ability to send busy and free times to people not on Exchange is really nice.
However, I do like the changes in Word and Excel, especially as it comes to sharing with other users.  It is nice to have control over what is shared and what isn't shared.  The improved digital signature is a fantastic benefit as well.
And Access.  I use Access all the time for my personal databases.  I was really concerned that this might be an upgrade like how 2000 was to 97 where you would need to convert everything over and it wouldn't be backwards compatible.  Thank goodness everything is backwards compatible.  That is a real life saver.  The backup feature is excellent as well!!

0,"While I can create pretty nice projects with this, there are some issues that I might call ""problematic."" Many of the features that seem to justify the ""Ultimate"" label (and, consequentially, the ""Ultimate"" price) seem like extraneous additions that few will use (or few will use with any amount of frequency). If forced to speculate, I would say that most consumers could easily purchase the ""Plus"" edition"" of this software (for considerably less) and be equally (if not more) satisfied.

Now, I have yet to experience any issues with the software. However, I have two friends who are also using it ...  and they have both had issues with it crashing. So, I'm basically bracing that to happen and hoping that it won't. If there are any incidents, I will update this post.

I have used Parallels 3.0 since it came out and I was overall satisfied, but found it a little slow.  Fusion 2.0 was released and I thought it would be a great way to get faster speed because that's what VMware was claiming and many users are reporting.

My biggest beef is the importation of existing virtual machines.  I have Win XP on my Mac that I use with Parallels.  VMware states that you can import from Parallels.  One, the process of importation is NOT intuitive and is made far more difficult than it should be.  Whoever designed this interface is not a Mac user.

Second, Fusion refused to accept the import stating that the virtual machine wasn't properly shut down.  So I go into Parallels and make sure that XP was been completely stopped.  Quit Parallels and go back to Fusion . . . oops, couldn't go back - first time in YEARS I saw the Mac gray crash screen.  I have never seen it on my Intel Mac until now.

I'm fine with Parallels.  I simply wanted to try Fusion because everyone said it was faster.  Yes, I could call customer support, but I that should NOT be necessary. I don't have patience for this kind of baloney, especially on my Mac.  It should work right out of the box, period.  I probably have hundred or more programs on my Mac and not one comes even close to being as big a pain as Fusion was in terms of installation.

0.5,"The Kaspersky Pure was installed on our guest room PC with Windows XP in July 2011. It replaced the Bit Defender Total Security that was starting to bog down the system with slow updates. To me, the best internet protection suites are the ones that work silently in the background, doesn't cause conflicts with other programs, and updates quietly and efficiently as scheduled. The Kaspersky Pure (KP) achieved that and even threw in some extra protection. In addition to real-time protection against viruses, malwares, and spywares; small, frequent updates + Cloud based updates; Two-Way firewall, Anti-phishing, etc., KP also provides Control Center management of all PC's in the home network, remote management of parental controls, etc. Especially helpful to consumers are the Password Manager, scheduled, Automatic data backup, Encrypted data vaults, and File shredder that effectively wipes deleted files off one's system permanently (non-retrievable).

We still warn visiting friends and relatives using the guest room computer to be careful about suspicious emails, questionable websites, clicking on unknown pop-ups, etc. A computer is only as safe as the common sense and precautionary measures the user utilizes!

In the past, payroll tax information could be entered manually. You had the option of paying for their automated service, but were not required to do so in order to enable the tax charts. In this version, you must pay for their automated service. If you're not willing to pay, your tax charts will not operate. If you're looking to pay one upfront cost you may want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, I find this update very worthwhile."
1,"I am a big supported of the Kaspersky software and have been using them for over 7 years.

This is a great product to protect you from spammers and hackers while you browse the Internet.

They also have this product as a 5-user package and I find that to be more usable for an average American family. Still, if you do not have as many devices, this product is for you. The software itself is identical on both editions."
0.5,"As a former journalist, I've manually transcribed hundreds of hours of taped interviews. It's slow and tedious but necessary when my notes didn't keep up with the conversation.

These days I periodically interview people for our company's blog. I use a digital voice recorder (sometimes my iPhone, other times my Tascam recorder) and use the recordings to write Q&A-style interviews.

While the new transcription feature is the one I find most appealing in Dragon Dictate for Mac 4.0, I also use the dictation part of the software on occasion when responding to several emails at the end of the day.

I would put the accuracy of diction at 95 percent and the transcription at about 75-80 percent when I am interviewing someone. The decline in accuracy for the transcriptions is probably because the software is not familiar with that person's voice. Dragon uses a ""voice training process"" that really helped improve the software's comprehension of my speech. (The process involves reading passages of prepared text.)

In fact I wrote the first half of this review using the diction mode. And this point on was transcribed from my digital voice recorder. The only issue I have with transcription mode is that I cannot figure out how to break up the text into paragraphs, so I have to go through and do that manually.

One sort of annoying thing I've noticed with the software, though, is that I have to sometimes hit ""quit"" and then restart it again for it to work. It seems to fall asleep if I use other programs that tap into the mic. This could be a bug or user error. I find the software works the best when using the included headset but it works with my Jabra Speak 510 speakerphone (which I use for Skype calls, mainly).

I wish I'd had this software in the 90s when I was an active journalist - it would have freed up a significant amount of time I spent transcribing interviews and my recorded notes.

OK, now typing this last part the old-fashioned way. For this review, the accuracy of the transcription mode was around 92 percent while the diction mode was around 95 percent. I'm impressed. If you do a lot of writing (and especially transcribing) you should consider Dragon Dictate for Mac 4.0."
-0.5,"I had high hopes for this product.  However, my hopes were dashed immediately after installation.  I installed the program on a fairly new machine running a fresh installation of XP-SP3.  Despite a problem-free installation, I noticed that I lost my Internet connection afterwards.  I discovered this while attempting to activate the program.  The application stated there was a problem with my Internet connection, but didn't realize it was the culprit.  I adjusted the firewall settings until I was able to restore Internet connectivity, however, a non-savvy user might have a harder time figuring out the problem, and they're the ones who need this type of application the most.  The program also displayed a bunch of pop-ups for firewall rules and real-time protection notifications, sometimes several at once.  I quickly opted to operate the firewall in ""silent mode"", which is supposed to limit notifications and create rules automatically, however, I still received quite a few pop-up notifications before they, thankfully, eventually diminished.  I then tried the update feature.  The update process was simple but it required two successive reboots to complete.

I finally got the program tamed, however, there were still some exisitng issues.  System resource impact wasn't too bad. Web browsing was fast and pages loaded quickly, although it takes quite a bit of time for web access to become available when starting Windows.  I also frequently lost web access and had to restart the browser several times to restore.  I also noticed a few extra seconds delay during startup and shutdown, but nothing alarming.  The scanning and malware engine seems pretty good and fast.  There is no right-click context menu scan, a major flaw.  In other words, no way to manually scan individual files, such as downloads, without scanning the entire system. The interface is otherwise clean with easily reachable menus/sub-menus.  The program can be completely or selectively disabled.

I feel the installation process is too problematic for the average user.  The default firewall settings are too restrictive and all of the initial pop-ups can be pretty confusing and irritating.  I also feel the lack of context-menu scanning and the frequent loss of network connectivity are serious minuses. I would look elsewhere."

But it did NOT direct me to any payment site.  It did this last year I now remember, and I got a nastygram from the IRS saying I had not paid my taxes.  This time I was forwarned, and contacted support about it.  They directed me to the site, and I paid there.....I hope.  No proof yet.  Just be aware of this.

1,"I have a laptop from 2009 with good hardware, but it was still running Vista. Needless to say Windows 8 32 bit is a much ""lighter"" operating system and the performance of my laptop has improved significantly. I could not believe how fast it installed and how I did not have 1 issue with it loading drivers for my hardware. The new interface is very easy to understand (you still have a desktop and start screen is your start menu). Overall very happy with the boot speed, software load speed, and interesting new interface. I think Windows will do well with the change.

Update- Also updated my desktop to 64 bit Windows 8 and love it. I am getting more and more familiar with the OS and love the fact a firewall and virus protection are built in. For those that are afraid, you can stay in a desktop environment for the most part and never leave. I don't expect Microsoft to allow people to turn off start screen without some third party hack."
1,I have been using this software for years and am very happy with it....easy to follow questions...and price was right too.
0.5,"We just got another new laptop to add to our plethora of systems in my house and I was eager to try this out on it before it was bogged down with all the other software we plan on using. I was pleasantly surprised at the ease of access while using this program. I had never really ventured outside of the AVG, Norton, McAfee, Kaspersky spectrum and was nervous that Webroot wouldn't be up to par with the big league names of Anti-Viral software...I was wrong!

Webroot AntiVirus seems to be running perfectly on the system. It has only been up and going for a couple days but it is smooth and hassle free. Our new Laptop is a 64 bit system with 500 GB of space and Windows 7 and it doesn't impede the systems performance at all! No major threats have been found when performing the sweepes and scans but the usual tiny little adware threats have been detected and removed with no problem.

This program seems like a great value for what it offers. Antivirus detection PLUS spyware detection is always important to have. I can see this lasting a long time and with the 3 user availibility it is going to come in REALLY handy for people with multiple systems. We are using Kaspersky's PURE for our other PC's right now and that is running flawlessly. Love it.

This is a great program though and really well worth the price!"
0.5,"With Norton 360, I haven't had to worry about nasty little bugs infiltrating my PC.  It's easy to use, especially since you can schedule scans, and I haven't had a problem which leads me to believe it's doing it's job.  The only downside that I found was having to disable other security software so that Norton 360 would work correctly.  Besides that, I like it."

It creates clear driving directions that can be emailed as a picture or as an attachment.  The map (either as an attachment or as a picture in the email) is high quality and easy to read.  The email with map and directions was only about 260KB

Another great feature is you can customize fuel cost and MPG city/highway to get fuel cost estimates for the routes that are being planned

Another handy feature is the ability to turn a map into a web page then easily integrates it into your site with either a simple web creator or one such as Front Page or Dreamweaver.

This is probably much more robust than what I needed but it will serve me well being able to email customized directions to my home office for my clients.  In the future I may use it as a tool to map where my clients are located and perhaps develop some marketing tools.

If you are looking for a more robust mapping program to intergrate with data this could very well be the ticket.  If you are just looking for some good mapping program consider Microsoft Streets and Trips."

I'd be more inclined to get new versions more often, if the upgrade price was cheaper, say $15.  Being a loyal user for years doesn't really get you any special deals, which is unfortunate."
1,Good stuff great quality s
1,"5 years ago or so, Norton was the slowest thing around. Then the completely redid the program and turned it into one of the easiest and quickest of the antivirus program. And it's continued since then as a great Antivirus. Maximum PC gave the 2013 Internet security version the only perfect 10 score of what they reviewed in the April 2013 issue.

And the 2014 continues being one of the best. It's quick, and it just works. There is the Norton Internet Security Version which gives you a little more internet protection. Then on top of the 360 version is supposed to add more stuff--but I think the 360 version is worthless. I usually buy the plain Norton antivirus because I feel that the internet security version slows the internet down a slight bit and I'm pretty careful on the internet.

Norton does a very good job of riding the line: It lets you do what you need to do, it's easy to use, it doesn't slow you down, and it takes care of viruses. There are other virus protections that might do some things better, but Norton really has the best balance. Could you still get a virus when using Norton? I'm a computer tech and have had clients get viruses no matter what they use--especially if the virus is really new or if a client does something that really invites it in. But I've seen Norton stop most viruses--immediately or with scanning.

The only reason not to get this is if the old version is on sale. The 2012 and 2013 include a free upgrade to the 2014. If you can get the old version on sale, you can download the 2014 trial and then use your 2012 or 2013 code (don't install from the old disk or there are more steps).

I'm a computer tech and if I have users who need more protection than the free Microsoft Security Essentials I install Norton (and in medium size business situations Trend Micro for bussiness or Symantec Endpoint). It works!"
1,Installs easily.  Haven't used it on the road yet but list of cities covered is impressive.
0.5,"I've used Norton intermittently since its programs shipped on floppy disk, and worked until they obsolesced or I replaced them with a similar utility or program from another vendor. Thus, you may not share my dislike of the notion of time-limited subscriptions rather than true purchases.

That said, however, Symantec does deserve credit for several aspects of the latest version of Norton 360, and I recommend this suite despite some concerns that are spelled out below. This review is a ""peek under the hood,"" if you will, that avoids the marketing-speak surrounding the product so that you will have an idea of what to expect. I also address installation, since earlier versions caused more than a few users some headaches in terms of installation or modification.

I've put this product through its paces on a MacBook Pro, an older Mac and several mobile devices and have found it less quirky than its predecessors. I also like that it straddles many platforms without the purchase of platform-specific licenses. Before installing, you will want to think about privacy settings or help a young user understand those choices, but otherwise installation and configuration are pretty straightforward. However, I would prefer that it be sold rather than rented, and that product manuals be provided in physical form -- especially for those times when you're troubleshooting an existing problem and Internet accessibility and/or device behavior may be part of the issues with which you're coping.

Positives:
+ The most noteworthy feature of this version of Norton is that it covers your choice of up to five devices -- straddling multiple platforms, rather than past versions, where you'd have to buy two multi-user keys if you wanted to cover both PCs and Macs. Once you've activated your account and registration, you can authorize and deauthorize devices from within a Norton dashboard; this is a more savvy approach than a specific ""install"" quantity that may be problematic if you replace a device. Kindle users, this add/delete function is to device registration you've done when managing your Kindle account.

+ Installation is most easily accomplished online. Take note that one of the two pieces of paper in the product box specifically advises that you install from the Norton website rather than using the enclosed CD if you are working from a PC, a Mac, or a mobile Android or iOS device. (Other verbiage indicates that the CD is for use solely with a PC.)

+ Norton account: If you haven't used Norton or Symantec products in a while, you may need to establish a Norton account, as installation and settings all seem to be controlled when you are logged in. If you move quickly through the account setup, an easy way to find and modify your preferences is to access your newly established account by way of the confirmation e-mail Norton sends. Unless you like receiving offers, during the registration process you will need to opt out of receiving e-mails. Note that Norton groups promotional e-mails with messages about security-related messages so you can't differentiate.

+ This program provides access to a healthy 25 GB of cloud storage. If used with the usual cautions -- such as not storing items of a confidential nature, such as financial material - such storage can be a bonus. However, this really should not be anyone's sole method of backup, especially considering that it is tied to a time-limited subscription.

+ You will be able to establish varying levels of security based on your location and the way you connect to the Internet in these various settings. Although my preference would be to pre-configure rather than deal with making choices on the fly while trying to establish a connection from the road, the process is relatively streamlined.  Look for ""Location Awareness"" in the dashboard; choices are clearly explained.

+ Time from downloading the first small file in the setup process through generating a Norton account with a basic dashboard configuration, downloading the rest of the suite, and being able to conduct your first scan will probably surprise you with its brevity. My time over a relatively slow Ethernet connection was 10:52, and yours may well be quicker, especially if you have more robust connectivity and/or already have a Norton account.

+ Scanning is quicker than I remember with earlier versions of Norton, and runs unobtrusively in the background; it doesn't seem to slow down my work in other programs.

+ The interface guides you into activating various features as you proceed with your daily online activities. When you browse the Internet after activating your subscription, for example, it asks whether you want to activate the Safe Web browsing interface. Similarly, it offers you a chance to configure an interface when visiting Facebook. Especially for younger and/or more trusting users, these features are welcome, although in the case of Facebook, rather than promoting Norton, the default setting should be Facebook's most private custom setting of ""only me"" rather than the default ""public"" setting. (Again, this would be more understandable for freeware or shareware rather than a retail subscription model.)

+ File Guard. This allows you to select files that cannot be opened or modified without your permission, and functions similarly to password-protecting such files as PDFs. This is a positive for those who don't already  have a program that does so, but it requires several clicks to accomplish.

Concerns:
- As noted earlier, I dislike the subscription approach to software and utilities. Norton does seem to respond to folks who feel this way by making it possible to avoid auto-renewal, although it can take some sleuthing to find that setting (the easiest route I found was through the confirmation e-mail).

- The dashboard interface sacrifices transparency for the sake of oversimplification; expect to spend time digging for what you're seeking.

- There's a noticeable amount of in-product upsell, whether for additional cloud storage, additional device licenses, or renewal. I expect this in free or shareware products, and am finding the volume in a paid product to be increasingly intrusive.

- Early in the install process, there's a bit of fine print about the program conducting auto-updates. While that may be a useful default setting for a novice user or someone who prefers not to make these decisions, I dislike enabling anyone's product to write on my drives without telling me what it wants to write -- and why. Note: I haven't found a workaround to this situation, but will update if and when I do. If you have a solution, please share it in the comments.

- Symantec draws on an approach it dubs ""DeepSight"" to gather data on cyber-attackers and updates your application to protect you. That aspect is a positive; however, the program's default configuration is for your devices to ""submit security events"" to Symantec. Although a disclaimer notes that no personally identifying information is included, this setting really should be configured as an opt-in rather than an opt-out."

0.5,"When I am planning a trip, I enjoy planning out the route, calculating the costs, finding nearby sites and restaurants...all of which I was able to do with this software.  For someone who revels in details, Microsoft Streets & Trips allows me to do so much more than I ever could with the free online navigation sites.

I found the interface fairly easy to use and had no issues.  Unfortunately, I found the execution of the GPS while traveling to be cumbersome at best.  We used our 17"" laptop, which takes up a lot of space in the front seat of the car (and must be held by someone) and is therefore rather awkward.  When leaving the computer turned on, it gets hot, and the battery wears out...not great for extended travel.

I may have done better on my Asus Eee PC, but lack the external drive to run the installation CD.  Nevertheless, I see the benefit of the trip planning software (even without the GPS) and imagine that the GPS feature would work well as long as you have the space and power for your computer.

If simply for the fabulous functionality of the route-planning software, I recommend this to anyone who is planning a trip and seeking a highly-customizable travel route."
1,"I will recommend people to read the manual before they use this program if they are novice for this.

Here's how the program work -

It record all your moves before it change anything.

You need to review the change before you confirm the changes.

Program shutdown & restart, then use the scripting to make change.

It's simple enough to use, but not fool-proof. I did screw up my system once (probably my fault) otherwise it work well at Win2K & XP. Anyway it still a good idea to back up all data before you do any changes.

This program can save you numerous time & effort if you wanna create, resize & copy the partitions. 5 stars!"

0.5,"Corel PaintShop Pro X7: What I didn't like; it took forever to install and register. I was able to install two other programs in less time than it took to install and register this program. I'm still not sure it actually did register. I entered my email address and it went to a white screen suggesting it was registering, but that was it. It took about 5 minutes to install. The first time I tried to open it, it wouldn't open. I got a blank dialog box and after several minutes I closed that and tried again. Finally it did open.
Once I did get everything working I tried to see the so called video tutorials. It took me online and there were tutorials on how to use my camera to take better pictures, but anything to do with learning this program took me to places where I could purchase stuff, online lessons or additional filters.
It was easy enough to figure out without the lessons and there is an online manual that can be downloaded. I like that you can use the simple, one step fix and it will evaluate your photo and adjust it for you. You can also use layers, like you can with Adobe, to do more professional photo editing. It has a full array of features to do just about anything you can think of. The ability to do all sorts of fancy text editing is really fun. You can put your photo onto text, it's fun. It also have a share button that lets you upload your photo to social media like FB and Google +
I installed the program on a windows 7 laptop. I like that it takes up less space than some of the other full feature photo editing programs. I was able to access photos on my other computers via the open and selecting my network, no hesitation or problem. I have had issues with other similar programs not being able to get onto my other computers.
After the frustration of installation, it is a fun, easy to use, full featured photo editing program. I like Corel. I find that I've been able to do things with this program that I can't figure out how to do with adobe."
1,"Having been a user of Rosetta Stone products for some time I was off and running very quickly with the Chinese language course. The software is easy to install and interesting to set up and get immersed into.

A word to the wise though. Some people may approach this process very casually and try to either blast through it or not take it very serious. I can only say that any user, regardless of their background, needs to take it slow and pace themselves.

1. Approaching learning Chinese with this program should be like taking any college course.
2. You should take notes and keep a journal of your progress.
3. After the first three days you should start to chart your progress.
4. You should practice with the system at least an hour a day for the first five days.
5. You should speak aloud as many of the phrases as you can after every period once you've stepped away from your computer.

You don't have to be a native speaker to stay on course and progress, but please don't think that you'll be disappearing into the crowd or ordering deftly from the menus of out-of-the-way dim sum restaurants any time soon.

I recommend this program for people who have a serious yen, no pun intended, to get a jump start on taking Chinese. Some folks like to think that taking a foreign language is about memorization and  repetition. But that just isn't the case, if it was, we'd probably all be home schooled via VCR.

Listen to me, nothing can compare to learning Chinese in a classroom, under pressure and under the gun of requirements and deadlines. The benefit and the beauty is participating with other classmates and going over the material in a setting that can also build your confidence. Learning at home alone, with a set of headphones doesn't really give you this, even though you may walk away with some sound basics. If you're going to study this over the summer and then concentrate on a double semester course in Chinese, you'll probably excel and be the star student. In this scenario, I cannot recommend it enough. If you're going to lock yourself in a dark room and try to learn Chinese with this, don't get your hopes up. You'll discover that the moment you open your mouth.

Best of luck, kind regards and don't forget your local Community College or State University."

Yet, with H&R Block tax software, I not only can effortlessly prepare my taxes, but I also can relax knowing that I've not made a simple, perhaps stupid mistake, since the software will catch those.

-0.5,"Stay Tuned for Danger is the follow-up Nancy Drew game to the award-winning Secrets Can Kill. While Stay Tuned for Danger still leaves quite a lot to be desired, it definitely shows improvement in the overall quality of the Nancy Drew games. This is a step in the right direction.

This game takes place shortly after Secrets Can Kill. Famous soap opera star of ""Light of Our Love"" fame, Mattie Jensen, has caught ear of how Nancy solved her last case. Mattie calls Nancy's Aunt Eloise (who's coincidentally a friend of hers) to request that Nancy fly up to her apartment in New York City to solve a brand new case. Mattie's co-star, Rick Arlen, has been receiving death threats. Nobody knows who they're coming from, and despite the treats becoming more serious, Rick refuses to go to the police. It's now up to Nancy to go undercover as an extra on the set to find a would-be killer...

The plot is solid, and despite the age of this game, it remains one of the greatest plots I've ever seen in a Nancy Drew game. It has a very mature, dark, and frightening atmosphere. Even though this game doesn't deal with curses or ghostly haunts, the threats that Rick (and later, Nancy) receives from the culprit become very life-threatening and haunting in and of themselves.

The quality of the game leaves a lot to be desired, but it's a big step up from Secrets Can Kill. Thankfully there is no longer any need to switch between discs. The controls still lack user friendliness, but they have improved slightly (now there is no longer need to scroll up and down through the environment as well as left to right). There are also more puzzles, some of them holding on to the quality level that the modern games have.

Sadly, it's very easy to run into glitches and have to start the game over. It's easy to miss important items that Nancy must pick up to solve the case, and therefore requires the player to start the game over again or wait a long period of time doing nothing until finally being able to get where Nancy needs to be to pick up the item. This is my biggest complaint about the game, as this makes it very frustrating for the player if he/she runs into these setbacks.

The graphics are still weak, but they've improved significantly. The characters are now 3D like the environments. They look more like Barbie dolls than actual people, but it's much better than having them look like 2D cartoons. The environmental graphics are of mostly the same quality as the first game, but that isn't a very bad thing (especially considering the age of this game).

The characters in this game probably rank among the best casts in a Nancy Drew game yet. There are SO many characters in the game (six suspects, with eleven characters playing a part of the story). The suspects include Mattie Jensen, who might be using Nancy to throw suspicion off of herself, Rick Arlen, who might be behind the threats to gain publicity, Dwayne Powers, Mattie's agent (formerly Rick's too) who is jealous of Rick's success, Millie Strathorn, the eccentric old lady who owns the WWB Network (the studio where ""Light of Our Love"" is recorded) and has a hard time differentiating truth from reality, Bill Pappas, the unseen producer of the show, and Lillian Weiss, the angry and bitter director of ""Light of Our Love"". There are also two characters who play roles in the story, but aren't interactive ""suspects"". These include Ralph Guardino, who is the security guard of WWB but can never really be questioned as a suspect, and Owen Spayder, an unseen stagehand who seems to have a larger role in the story later on. Nancy's best friends Bess Marvin and George Fayne and her boyfriend Ned Nickerson can still be called for help like in the first game, but they're also able to be conversed with about her case and even provide insight into the case itself.

The music in the game is also well done. I prefer the Secrets Can Kill soundtrack, but the soundtrack heard in this game is also very enjoyable. It held on to the perfect ""New York City"" feel while leaving off an atmosphere of mystery. The music heard while sneaking into the studio at night made the place all the more eerie, while the music heard while exploring Mattie's apartment during the day was rather upbeat. I'd say that the soundtrack was perfect.

While Stay Tuned for Danger remains a bit of a sub-par game, it's a drastic improvement compared to its predecessor. If you've played this and are considering giving up of the Nancy Drew games, please don't do so yet. Starting with Message in a Haunted Mansion, the Nancy Drew games really do get better from here on out, and Stay Tuned for Danger does tell an awesome story that's worth experiencing. I'm hoping that a re-release of this game is issued (like the one they did with Secrets Can Kill, but staying more true to the original this time), because it could use some improvements and the original isn't compatible with computers more advanced than Windows XP. Those who started playing the Nancy Drew games later on deserve to experience the first two games, and the first two games also deserve better quality. So, here's to hoping for Stay Tuned for Danger Remastered!"
0,"This review is somewhat incomplete as to all content only because this item is out well before tax season.  Therefore, these are my initial impressions I will update as I continue to work on tax returns.

This particular mode of Turbotax is aimed at those with rental properties and investments.  However, in my experience, unless you have a complex business in regards to self-employment, this mode will easily allow you to complete self-employment taxes (again, routine and fairly simple accounting for SE taxes, more complex stuff this is not the route to go).

Installation is easy and my previous use was fine in terms of adapting the information to the current tax year from previous years.

The biggest problem people had last tax year was apparently the issues with some forms not being available, but personally I was able to complete all my tax issues without having any problems with that particular issue.  Here, at cursory examination, there seems to be no issue with this problem evident (although supposedly it was addressed).

In terms of changes, there are not huge dramatic changes evident in the program I have found.  The program is pretty similar to what I have found before in terms of consistent interfacing.

At this point, I give this product a good rating, it is the consistent program I have used for at least a decade and still delivers the ability to make sense of the literally insane tax regulations provided by out lovely officials.  In fact, I could not imagine doing income taxes of any difficulty without using a computer program (I would say it impossible).

At this juncture, solid and a fine product."
-0.5,"Well phooey. I ordered this 2009 version, expecting it to surely work with my pre-release version of Microsoft Windows 7, but that turned out not to be possible. The installation disk did not recognize Windows 7 as a supported version. I then attempted to load the pre-release version available within Windows 7 itself, only to discover that version didn't fully work either, with the vendor's discussion board stating Windows 7 isn't officially supported yet.

I then tried installing the program on a Windows XP machine, only to discover after installation that it is incompatible with the free version of Zone Labs' firewall I've carefully tuned over a period of years.

It's nice such packages are now covering more security bases for users, but I'm a fan of using best-of-breed products, and only wanted this to be an anti-virus, not also a firewall or anti-spam product. At the very least, I'd like to be able to choose at install time which aspects of the program I wish to use.

Next time I need to build an XP PC from scratch, I'll try this again, but for now, much as I looked forward to trying this product, it's shelfware."
-1,"With the crippling and removing of important forms for e-filing in TurboTax Deluxe, like Schedules C, D, and E, I am rating this one star. I use to use this product but I can't anymore.

Avoid TurboTax if you can and go with a better product that doesn't try to gouge you with surprise upgrade fees when you are doing your taxes. If you are able to easily move from TurboTax, than take advantage of that and switch now before you get locked in and it becomes more complicated to switch.

And don't forget that Intuit has lobbied Congress in the past to kill any chance of simplified IRS tax filing. You can probably guess why they would not want people to quickly and easily be able to file their taxes without their software. Search Google for ""Intuit lobbying congress against simple filing"" and ""Corruption Is Why You Can't Do Your Taxes in Five Minutes"" for more info."
1,I have used Quicken for years and usually up grade when new versions are available. It makes it easy to balance your bank statement every  month and track your savings.
0.5,"The software loaded and functioned with no problems and bugs.
I am not a power user, I occasionally use it to map some geographic distribution data- it does the job for me and I have no complaints. The maps I print out for presentations look a tad basic, like a high school project- I have not looked carefully to see if more attractive maps can be found as templates in the program or downloadable from the internet.
The road maps and GPS feature are very similar to Microsoft's Streets and Trips interface- I did not discern any primary differences between the two programs- they work adequately as planning software for business visits. To use them for real time navigation will be quite awkward without looking like you're driving a police cruiser with the lap top. It is also dangerous too to do that.

Overall, a competent program that adequately addresses my needs."
-1,"If you're like me, you've spent much time with these consumer-level security software over the past few years.  Chances are that your experiences were not entirely positive. While offering some clear value to us, they normally come preloaded on computers and bombard you with notifications and updates, while draining valuable system resources (I HATE THAT don't you?). As such, these programs have gotten a reputation for being bloated and inefficient, while free antivirus offerings, like AVG and Avast, have proven themselves to be worthy alternatives, at least for core features.

Strengths: Good at scanning for viruses and malware. Tons of features, easy to use.  Report and monitor internet attempts/ Hits on your PC. Pretty bells sounds and graphs.

Weaknesses: Terrible load times and slow to respond. Kept crashing after roughly 9 months of use - customer service was terrible. Can bog down system though not as bad as Norton Internet security suite. Nightmare to update, renew, and if something goes wrong, another nightmare to uninstall. Poor Tech support.

Overall Evaluation: If you can get it to load, and get it to respond (even on a fairly quick computer it took forever), then it's a decent protection package. However, if you really don't know a lot about protection programs or have a very short temper when it comes to computers, I suggest staying away - this package causes headaches and so does customer support.  As owner of my equipment I agree to abide by software protocols. McAfee is different. Once their software GRABS your PC. You cannot escape. Sooner you will delete essential files than remove McAfee from registry.  The software written not to be deleted. Scare?? yup.. I've experienced this FIRST hand.  McAfee has ""parasite"" my unit so I had to rebuild. Mcafee has unveiled an improved UI, which makes the software easier to use. It seems effective in protecting my machines from harm, but couldn't it do it without bogging down my computers so much?"
0.5,CorelDraw X5 is a great tool for those who need the power but do not require the professional features of the higher models.  It is a bit too specialized for general use but is easy to master once you get over the learning curve.  Installation was relatively painless but slow and it works decently well on a low end machine (such as my Windows XP unit from almost a decade ago).  Overall this is a great compromise for those that need this sort of software but keep in mind that you are limited in feature set .  The price is still on the higher side but the bigger issue is that there is no way to upgrade to the full featured big brother so make sure it does what you need it to do before buying.
-0.5,"Windows 8 and it's spawn 8.1 really suck.  I had bought a new laptop with windows 8.  It might be good for a tablet or phone; but on a computer, it is a bloody torture.  And of course, here comes the Blue Screen of Death! They even put an emoticon of a frowny face on it.  What operating system would have a song singing, ""honestly, I want to see you be brave?"" Honestly? Bravery is not what you need to run a laptop.  You should open it, start it, have it be easy and work."
1,"Of all .ZIP and compressed file decompressing software, WinZip has always been my favorite and remains so. I've never noticed any performance issues created after installing or while using it. It does what it's supposed to do, and I've yet to encounter a file myself that WinZip hasn't been able to handle. I've always enjoyed Corel's products, and yet again they have proven why to me."

1,"There's so much to like about the newest Corel VideoStudio Ultimate X8 that it's hard to know where to begin.

First, installation is easy and faster than with X7. It supports Mac-compatible devices including iPadstouch and iPhone. Also Android smartphones, everything for PCs, including cameras and camcorders that recorded with internal memory..pretty much whatever you have or can think of . You do need a Windows-compatible sound card, Windows-compatible DVD-ROM drive, and Windows-compatible DVD burner for DVD output* (Windows-compatible Blu-ray Disc burner for Blu-ray Disc and DVD output recommended).

Installation was done in under 15 minutes. The Plug-ins took longer, but still less than half an hour.  You still can have as many as 21 video tracks and four audio tracks. It is easy to upload video to Facebook or YouTube,

If you're editing 3D and full HD video, Corel recommends an Intel Core i7 or AMD Phenom II X8 processor with Windows 7 or Windows 8 64-bit operating system and minimum 4 GB of RAM.  Ultimate X8 can edit 4K video, but they recommend a 4th generation Intel Core i7 processor.

""New MOV (H.264 format) support expands VideoStudio's export options, which also include AVI, MPEG-2. QuickTime, WebM, Windows Media Format, HTML5 and more"" more formats such as support for AVI, MPEG-2, AVC/H2.64, WMV, MPEG-4, MKV and MOV (H.264 format) and more.  The ""blue screen"" NewBlue Background Generator can turn your video into a nice background. Triple Scoop Music gives music to use, including some full vocals. The plugins have over 150+ effects for transitions and credits

Remembering back when I started video editing on the clunky cumbersome Final Cut Express, it's incredible to me how many sophisticated things we can do now with software that costs less than $90. So many things that used to depend on fillming technique can now be fixed digitally--shaky camera, poor audio, even lousy lighting. There's no reason not to create a professional-looking video when you have all these options, including adding professional-type filters, special effects, and lots of titling options.

The interface is the easiest I've used and the versatility of the software allows you to do pretty much whatever you want; I'd guess most people will never use even half of all that's available, but the parts you will use will give you smoother, better results than the earlier versions (if they had these capabilities at all). Great price, too. Definitely recommended."
1,Great product
-1,"The download for this product takes 3 to 4 hours and two times so far it resulted with a message ""network error"".  Unbelievable.  I am giving it one more attempt and if it doesn't work will request refund as I've never installed the incomplete download.  And I thought Norton was a pain!"
1,I have been using this product for years.  This new 2015 product now includes both Internet Security and Norton 360 instead of separate programs prior to this version.  They are now both incorporated into this one product.  Norton has always been one of top rated for Internet Security programs.

0.5,Its a freaking app that allows you read the books you paid for. Why does one need a review?
1,"I admit when I first noticed Streets & Trips I thought, ""What can this offer me that Mapquest or Google maps can't, for free?"" The answer to that comes rather quickly. And that is, a trip planner without requiring the internet. For those that don't have a GPS (or do have a GPS but have one that is so outdated it's not even updated anymore, like mine) this is a really useful tool to have along on your trip. Sure, those super expensive GPS will do everything this does and more, but hey, they are also hundreds of dollars more! If you have a laptop, netbook, anything that can run this program, you have an instant GPS without any need of paying subscription fees, paying for updates, etc. It can't track where you are all call out directions, but once upon a time all we had was a thing called ""maps"" and we did just fine. Streets & Trips is a huge step up from your map and almost as good as a GPS without the hefty price tag. Plus, it's just really fun to use if you're a planner like me. If you love planning every single little detail of your trip, want to know exactly how much you are going to spend and where, you will have a lot of fun with this. It has a lot of bells and whistles that the free mappers can't provide. If you're not into GPS or just don't want to shell out the dough to get a nice one, Streets & Trips may be just what you are looking for."

1,"I have been using Norton 360 for all of my PC and laptops at home for many years. It is a trusted product and is more stable than many similar products out on the market.

Here is what I like about this product :

- provides robust protection against on-line threats and viruses
- does not take up a lot of CPU and memory resources
- automatic and user programmable scanning and optimization

0,"First of all this is a basic edition.  Some of the aspects of the full software are missing.  Second its very hard to import your own designs.  We're still having issues with that.

Still as a simple animation program it is easy to use.  You can take the characters provided and make them dance and move around in a very limited Hanna Barbara type 2d cartoon way.

My son who is very into learning 3d arts and has a desire to design video games played with it for a few days.  He made som interresting animations with it but grew bored in the end.

I'd say it is a good product for people new to animation like myself but for people with a prior experiance in creating their own, it will be found wanting."
-1,"I will definitely NOT buy this product.  I refuse to be RIPPED OFF $10 for EACH AND EVERY time you e-maill or call customer service.  This is totally ludicrous, and the support service should be included with the purchase of the product.  Apparent Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking is trying to squeeze every nickle and dime out of their customers.  I refuse to by any product by a company that will do that to their customers.  I think this is about the ONLY company that charges for their support.  Try to find an alternative voice recognition software company who will support their product free of charge.  SHAME ON YOU, NUANCE DRAGON NATURALLY SPEAKING."
0.5,"Corel's WordPerfect Office X6 program suite provides a full-featured set of applications for all your office computing needs. It is generally not hard to install, though some systems may have programs installed that interfere, so it's best to close out everything else that is running before starting the installation. If you have X5 and are satisfied then there's not much reason to upgrade - Winzip, the program that began as popular shareware, is an addition to X6 that most people won't really need. WordPerfect Office is compatible with MS Office/Word formats so you can exchange files between the two, and there is similar functionality. Each suite has its strengths and weaknesses depending on the needs of the user. WordPerfect is more affordable since it doesn't have the market dominance that MS Office has. For those really on a tight budget there is the OpenOffice program that can be obtained for free online from Sun MicroSystems. That one handles the basics well but lacks a lot of extra features and options that you can get in the commercial Office suites. For those who are in need of a suite that includes resources for word processing, presentations, spreadsheets, file management, Internet integration, and more, I would recommend considering WP Office X6 - if you have a recent PC model. If your PC is pretty old it might not handle the latest software so well, so you should check the recommended system specs before getting the software. Corel has done a nice job keeping the Word Perfect tradition going strong, as Word Perfect was the 1st word processing application I ever used, back in the MS-DOS era! Things have changed a lot in the last couple decades, while WordPerfect has managed to adapt and continue to serve millions of computer users."
1,"Got this router about a year ago and it has been absolutely trouble-free ever since. I've had three previous wireless routers and they all began to malfunction within a few months of service. This one is as reliable as the sunrise and pretty inexpensive, making it a pretty good buy. At the moment I have my desktop, printer/fax/copier/scanner, laptop and one Panasonic network security camera connected to this router, all wireless, and they all work very reliably. Not a high-end router, but very reliable. Kinda like a VW Bug, not real sexy, but does what it was intended to do."
0.5,"Even though I'm an amateur, I take my photography seriously, and I was interested in seeing what AfterShot Pro 3 could do.  Most of my ""serious"" shots are of birds and nature, but I also take urban shots and people.  I'm not interested in special effects as much as I am in correcting small issues that I failed to see when taking the photos.  While this software is designed for professional photographers who take hundreds, even thousands, of photographs in a day, it works well for those of us who want to touch up a single shot or to process hundreds of photographs after a trip.

I have a Mac, and the program has so far worked flawlessly with the OS.  I've used Adobe Elements, and this Corel AfterShot Pro 3 is more powerful and faster than the version of Elements I used.  Although much about the software is intuitive, especially if you've used other photo editing software, you really need to download and read the Adobe manual to get the most out of it.  The manual is a behemoth at 220 pages, so I'm not about to print it; instead, I print out the specific pages that I'll know I'll need to refer to often and merely access the others on my computer.

I love that it never alters the original and instead saves edits in a file with an .xmp extension that keeps the processed photo entirely within the program until I'm ready to export it.  (According to the documentation, the xmp file cannot be opened by any other program to keep it safe within the Corel.) And I love that I can add plug-ins, both free and not, to enhance the editing experience.  The key to using AfterPro 3 is the use of catalogs/folders to organize photos into work groups.  Once you open up a folder, you'll get thumbnails running along the side of your screen so that you can quickly access the ones that you want.  In addition to the standard adjustments you'll find in most budget software packages, AfterShot Pro 3 allows to adjust RAW noise, apply lens correction according to the make and model, access and add metadata, apply watermarks and copyright notices, apply presets such a bluer skies and portrait, and a host of other tools.

The program does a lot more than I need; however, it will allow me to grow with it. I recommend that anyone, especially professionals, considering the purchase of AfterShot Pro to download the Adobe manual from the website to ensure that this will do what you want.

I am a great booster of Norton and have used it since the TRS 80 days, but this new version came as a card with those endless serial numbers which are so easy to type wrong. Then I got into an endless battle about my password which I had entered before the stone age and had forgotten. Result: I don't know whether or not this is a good program because I am still trying to load it. I only want it for one machine, but my purchase is so over protected and guarded less I try to use it on six machines, I am totally disgusted and will have to go waste more time trying to load it."

1,"Cyberlink PowerDirector 11 is a fun, intuitive, and easy to learn video editing program.  It is highly stable and not susceptible to crashes like some other consumer level video editing software titles.  It offers a full feature set that allow the novice to grown and take on more and more advanced projects.  You have unlimited sound and video tracks to add to your project, as well as popular green screen and PIP options.  It offers everything from full control over you creations to wizards that can create a movie or slide show for you after you select what assets you'd like included.  It accepts a wide range of video codecs and has a good library of effects and music to use as well as multiple output options.  You can burn your own DVDs with templates and menus, output to your computer or portable device, or directly upload to the leading social networking and video sharing websites. I really can't say enough good about this program, I love it.  While Pinnacle Studio used to be my favorite editor for short projects, but now PowerDirector is my program of choice for such things.  You can expand your library of effects, transitions, and music from leading content providing sites like Smart Sound and New Blue FX.  In my opinion, when it comes to effects though, less is more if you want to create a straight forward and attractive presentation.  It is one of the only video editing programs that offers a full printed manual as well as online tutorials and ample in application help.  If you are new to video editing, or a more experienced editor who just wants to get back to basics I highly reccomend this program.

For those wanting to experiment with 3D, PowerDirector 11 can edit footage from your 3D video camera or allow you to convert 2D footage to 3D Anaglyph productions.  This is a good option for the novice who does not have all the expensive 3D peripherals and wants to share 3D films with family or friends.  A pair of anaglph glasses are included and inexpensive cardboard ones are available for purchas online as well as slightly more expensive ones made out of plastic.  If you want to share, I'd reccomend buying the cardboard ones and sending them to your intended audience or have them on hand to show your 3D films on your regular TV set--no 3D TV set required."
-1,"I have used Roxio's products for years, starting with Easy CD Creator 15 or so years ago.  They had a really good product back in the day, as well as a pretty good video editing component for home movies to DVD, but over the years each new upgrade brought more and more problems and their technical support unit never would help you unless you paid them a fee.

While not directly relevant to the review of this specific version of the software, it does set the stage for this version as I was apprehensive about trying it in the first place.  To put it in a nutshell, it had a heck of a time trying to install on a Windows 7 machine - it wouldn't install at all and the software aborted the installation after about an hour of trying (no kidding).

I did go to Roxio's online support board because they won't answer a phone, and I saw a list of similar issues / complaints from other customers.  I was unable to resolve the issue and am no longer trying to install the software.

At least Roxio is consistent with their software product and lack of customer support.  I'm very glad I received a review copy vs. paying the recommended retail price of $99 or even one dollar for it.  I would give this one a wide berth."
0,"f you like WIll Farrell's other movies, you'll like Land of the Lost. While not as good as Kicking and Screaming, it's actually pretty funny. And, remarkably, it's not all sex and fart jokes. This isn't a PG movie - obviously, Will Farrell is the star. But a lot of the jokes are just dry humor, rather than Old School-style comedy. I also found all the abuse Chakra took pretty hilarious. Danny McBride has some funny scenes too.

I felt like one of the things preventing this from being a 5-star movie was the quality of the special effects. The parallel universe seems a bit empty. The dinosaurs aren't anatomically correct - even compared to Jurassic Park. The CG seems a cartoonish. The Tyrannosaur drags its tail close to the ground, an obviously inaccurate portrayal. I think the film was trying to go for a classic Land of the Lost: The Complete Series. However, as a natural history aficionado, it would have been nice if the dinosaurs looked more realistic.

On the other hand, the Sleestaks look awesome. They have a retro look - they look like guys in lizard suits, but done really well.

Overall, Land of the Lost is definitely worth checking out. Good for a few laughs."

You risk losing all your hard-won insight into your family ancestry, as the software has more glitches than the B-24 in WWII or the Boeing 787 of today. The ""sync"" function is a time trap and effort-waster, and the fixes proposed do not work. The lines are always busy when you call for help, and even if you get through, the operators are more interested in reading their scripts from the screen in front of them than in finding a solution.

-1,"I've been using TurboTax and Quicken for many years and with each new version I buy, I edge closer to looking at the competition. This year's TurboTax is probably pushing me over the line.

  First, I truly hate the endless in-your-face advertising for other Intuit products. I am buying a software product and paying a healthy price for the usability of the software - not to have an endless stream of ads for other Intuit products shoved in my face.

  Secondly, TurboTax's help system is just plain awful. This is the first year I received Social Security payments - and I had questions about their taxability. I had to go through three layers of help menus before winding up with an official IRS publication. Why have three layers of superfluous inapplicable information?

  Intuit pushes a lot of the burden online for help, which is not the most efficient - or helpful - facility to use.

  Picking up your last year's tax return as a starting point for the current year is not a wise move. Better to start from scratch.

  The ""guided interview"" is ridiculous. A one size fits all approach wastes a lot of your time.

  Overall, I think this is my last year of not considering alternatives to TurboTax. Intuit has done a lot of rotten things to its customers. A few years back, they implemented a copy protection scheme that could cripple your computer. This year they implemented an outlandish charge for printing alternate returns. On both occasions, Intuit backed down with an explanation that they ""blundered"" - but not before trying to rip off their customers.

  Hopefully there is an equivalent or better product out there because I am fed up with TurboTax and its arrogance toward its customers.

The government needs no better proof of why a monopoly is bad for consumers than to add up all the crashes, incompatibilities, and lousy performance results that Windows has chocked up over the past twenty years.  Pathetic.  Those in the know will tell you that Windows has kept a cottage industry of computer technicians and troubleshooters gainfully (and lucratively) employed; to them, it has been the goose that laid the golden egg.  A big, fat egg.
Now we have XP.  It's only been out a short time, but it seems to be far more stable than its predecessors.  It's about time.  It still crashes from time to time and gets buggy when you try to ""plug and play"" various peripherals, but those problems haven't led to system meltdown yet.  Thankfully.  But we should have had an operating system like this from Microsoft years and years ago.  There is nothing technologically innovative or superior about Windows XP.  It simply works pretty well and most people should be happier with their computers than they've ever been.  (Windows 2000 is essentially Windows XP; I've heard the same kinds of comments about it:  It does what it is expected to do most of the time without bringing your system down.  Fingers crossed, it seems to actually be an operating system that isn't an Edsel.)
But there are operating systems out there that are well-ahead of Windows XP.  Mac OS X is such an operating system.  Much easier to use.  Much more stable.  Much more elegant.  Yet, because of the entrenched Windows monopoly, few give it a chance.  But, today, there is no reason to stick with Windows.  The new Mac OS is completely compatible with any Windows network (Mac OS X is based on UNIX, which is the most time-tested stable operating system ever, and also the basis for the industrial LINUX operating system), has all the popular programs that work on Windows (including a marvelous new Office for Mac X that bests the Windows version of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Entourage).  It also has the best multimedia programs in the business--none of which are available for Windows.  Burn CDs and DVDs, use the best mp3 player out there (the iPod), handle digital cameras and photographs effortless, make your own home movies without even cracking an owner's manual.  And, Apple has the best buy in a home computer system:  the new iMac G4.
Fight the power.  Try something else.  Linux.  Mac OS X.  Send a signal to Microsoft that it isn't going to be business as usual anymore."
1,"Again, year after year, a great product.  In the years past I have never had any difficulties with incoming malware, etc.  This past few months it seems there have been 'clever' hackers at work - and some have made it through this sophisticated defense system.  I now believe the current hackers that have gotten very busy and done their homework well.

The fault is not necessarily Kasperskys - but it is beginning to create a doubt, ""can KIS2015 keep up with the latest breed of extraneous malware?""

Nevertheless I am still convinced this is the best product on the market, and will continue using it.  Wait until next year when I go to renew this version.  I'll reevaluate, then make sure to tell you what I think!"
1,"I've been using Norton's Internet Security for years but about 6 months ago I started having a lot of problems with my computer freezing up during the virus definition updates (which seem to occur a couple times a day).  Therefore, I was interested in trying another company's product.

During installation of this product I had to remove SpyBot software because of conflicts between the two programs.  While I wasn't happy doing that--I thought I would at least give this program a try and if necessary go back to Norton's products. The rest of the installation process went smoothly and my computer has stopped freezing up!  It does seem to take a bit longer to boot up when I first turn it on--but otherwise I can detect no other changes.

PC World ranks this as their 10th top choice (and they rank Norton's Internet Security as their top), but this one works on my computer much better.  If you are having trouble with your computer freezing up and you suspect it might be your virus software I suggest you try this program."
0.5,"Norton Internet Security 2012 is a good all around package for those that like to ""set it and forget it"".  Norton really has made great strides in recent years in reducing the heft of the program and the resources used while it is running in the background.

I would recommend it for those that don't want to manage their firewall intrusions, virus threats, network allowed devices/services through the firewall, and other such items.

1,"This is the third version of this software that I've used. Quicken WillMaker keeps getting better and better. I like to keep my will and legal documents up to date to reflect changes in my life's circumstances. It's really important to do this, and that can't be overstated. For my needs this software covers all areas and more. What's so nice about it is the fact that you're walked through each and every step through a series of comprehensive questions that cover just about everything you can think of. This is important and  is worth  spending the time it takes to go through all the documents that you'll find contained within this software. We're all living on borrowed time, so having our affairs in order makes things easier for those who'll be left behind when we pass. Being able to clearly outline my legal wishes dealing with my affairs, knowing that these circumstances can be an emotional burden for others not prepared to make decisions on my behalf, so that they don't have to gives me peace of mind.

This software covers a will, as well as power of attorney, advanced directives, and a host of others, and one of the most important of these is our complicated online lives. There are questions to prompt the user to document usernames and passwords for a host of very important areas of our digital world that we now have to deal with on an almost daily basis. Leaving that information behind for others is extremely important and I'm glad it's covered in considerable detail here.

Also touch upon with this software is the importance of securing our information while we're sill alive and breathing. Nice to know that Qucken WillMaker is aware of this and deals with it.

I've recommended this software to several friends and will continue to do so. For average folks such as myself, this software gets the job done."
1,I've used Norton Ghost 14.0 without problems but needed to upgrade to Ghost 15.0 which supports Windows 7.  So far no issues.  It was simple to install.  Don't forget to register your product with Symantec.
0,"Like other reviewers, I was a bit disappointed in the quantity and variety of the forms offered (a smattering of forms for each of the 10 subject areas: ""buying or selling a business,"" ""contracts for goods and services,"" ""corporate minutes and consents,"" ""forming a business,"" ""hiring workers,"" ""leasing space,"" ""LLC minutes and consents,"" ""managing finances,"" ""buying and selling real estate,"" and ""tax forms"").

Frankly, for a program with ""pro"" in the title, I expected much more (I had never been disappointed with either Quicken/Intuit or NOLO products in the past).

A savvy scrounger can probably get the same forms offered in this software suite from the internet at no cost. The advantage of this software is that each document takes the user through an interview process and builds the document step-by-step. But none of the documents offered seemed to be so complicated that using this software was an absolute must.

If there is real value in the software, it probably comes in the form of the six NOLO books in .pdf (or .chm) form. They are ""Legal Guide For Starting & Running a Small Business"" (.chm), ""Deduct It!"" (.pdf), ""The Manager's Legal Handbook"" (.pdf), ""How To Write A Business Plan"" (.pdf), ""Contracts"" (.pdf), and ""The Essential Guide To Federal Employment Laws"" (.pdf).

I get that Quicken/NOLO wanted to keep the program affordable. But I'm not so sure a larger selection of forms would truly raise the cost of the product. So while the cost has been kept down, all-in-all I'm not sure this software merits the cost: I just don't see the buyer as getting his/her money's worth. That's too bad as I I usually am very enthusiastic about Quicken/Intuit/NOLO products."
-1,"I wish I could say something substantive about this product, but it wouldn't download for me, telling me they were ""unable to download the support packages"" and to ""check your internet connection and try again."" I have a PhD in electrical engineering, which if nothing else means I should be able to install software. So, if there's something I was doing wrong, they should rethink their installation. That said, I don't think I did anything wrong, I think they just had a server down. I validated that my internet connection was working, and in fact their install program did download quite a bit of data. It just kept giving me the same error message after the download completed. For what it's worth, I'm using a Mac with OS X 10.9.

I tried this three times, and then gave up. Is it fair to give this one star? I think so. Maybe they just had a server down the times I tried. But if that's the level of service we can expect from software as important as this, I think it speaks volumes to the low level of commitment Symantec has for this product, at least for those of us using Macs. I hope this works great for most people, but my experience was very poor, and I have to reflect that in the rating. If my experience is atypical, and I hope it is, that will average out in the total ratings."

0.5,"I'm a user of Photoshop for professional stuff and also a user of free or very cheap products for more basic edits. I have to say that this program is far closer to the free options than the expensive ones.

It has a ton of good stuff going for it:
+Nice auto tools, including autofix, and some correction tools.
+I like the toothbrush, thinify (changes aspect ration to make your target look thinner without changing the ratio of the pic), suntan, etc
+Lots of instant effects.
+I was able to click through more than 30 changes and undo them all. That's a lot of undo steps!
+It's easy to grab your photos from folders and track your pics.

Some gaps that you should consider:
-The tools are only slightly better than what you'd find in free programs like Picasa.
-The variety of instant effects was low comparable to many full function programs.
-This isn't a replacement for Photoshop or Gimp. It doesn't allow full editing. Just photo adjustments.

This is a good program and for those who need a few additional tools over free programs I recommend you download the trial and see if this is what you need. For those who simply want to adjust a few photos and keep them in a single place then maybe try some of the free tools out there."

1,"When I first started fooling around with we pages back in 1994 when the Internet was fresh and new my HTML editor of choice was a simple text editor.  Over the years the Internet has evolved and technology has changed, but I've stuck with a simple text editor for most of my needs.  I tried Microsoft Frontpage back in the day, but felt it was just so bloated and inefficient that it wasn't worth it.  It was with hesitation and a lot of reservations that I finally decided to give Microsoft Expression Web a shot -- and wow, Microsoft has come a long, long way.

First thing about Expression Web is that it's so flexible depending on your skillset.  Are you still working with Frontpage extensions?  No problem!  Are you moving up to using stylesheets?  It will guide you and help you along!  Maybe you run your own site with custom coding -- Expression understands PHP, Javscript and ASP without a problem!  It will even do syntax checking as you write the code.

Even if you are a web guru Expression Web can help you out.  With extensive support for XML, CSS and data sources you will find everything you need to keep your site chugging.

Gone is the inefficient, slow and incompatible features of Frontpage and in is the support for WWW, XML and CSS standards.  You'll love how it can help you not only keep your site compliant with the latest standards, but also how it helps with promoting your site from ""dev"" to ""prod"" with just a few clicks.

I tried Dreamweaver in the past, and found it not only too complicated, but way too expensive.  Expression Web is really going to give Dreamweaver a run for their money -- and their user base.  Once you get the hand of Expression Web you may even find yourelf looking at the other Microsoft Expression products such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Expression-Blend-2/dp/B0013ITQ9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Expression Blend 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Expression-Encoder-2/dp/B0013IRKCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Expression Encoder 2</a>&nbsp;to further expand your web toolkit."

WHAT?! you contacted me?! the product itself i would have given five stars but the black hole they call their customer service department,..nothing ever gets in our out e.g. the analogy used."
1,"i have been dealing with A/V suites for well over a decade now and kaspersky is one of the best. it does what it is supposed to do and the layout for end users is intuitive and really straight forward. it is one of the simplest and smartest layouts i've seen from any A/V maker. if you have another antivirus on your device first you need to remove it. if it starts up with your pc then you need to disable it as a startup item, restart your pc then remove it. reboot then install the new kaspersky software. don't overlap the two unless you want to risk a nightmare scenario of tech troubles. second you can go to the kaspersky site and download a FREE thirty day trial of the software (not a pared down version but the real deal). you can get a feel for it that way and then when your software arrives from amazon you just need to enter in the product key/code and you are good to go. fyi immediately after installing the software no matter if you download it or install it from cd,...UPDATE your virus definitions. it is a substantial file and it took me more than a half hour to download and install them all. also unlike some antivirus suites like b.defender there are NO annoying pop up ads, spam, yet another reason i chose kaspersky over the competition. if i pay for something i deserve a product that works and to be spam free and you get that with kaspersky."

I have to say that the features Painter 11 provides make the possibilities of use pretty much endless. I could definitely see this meeting all the needs of even the most advanced users. There have been a few buggy things with different features since release, but the nice thing is Corel is usually right on top of it with a patch for fixing even the most minor issues. I've found experimentation with Painter 11 to be a blast, and I've actually surprised myself with how much I've learned and what I've created so far with it.

1,"As someone new to video editing, I found Video Studio X7 to be very helpful. The tutorials are great for getting you started, and the FastFlick option is a very easy way to help create your first videos. Using FastFlick, the program walks you through the process, and it's just a quick 3 steps to create your video using template options. It makes creating a video very easy to follow - especially while you're learning the program.

After a little use, I still like FastFlick for creating quick simple videos, but the additional flexibility and customization available through the regular video creation is also fantastic. Including titles, credits or subtitles is very simple, and the Capture studio allows you to film video to edit in the program directly from your webcam or compatible camera.

The stop-motion studio is very useful as well, and super easy to use. It likewise can be utilized through the Capture studio, using your webcam or camera to input images into the program as you take each picture. It even has an ""onion skin"" feature, allowing you to see a see-through copy of your previous picture overlapping your next one, so you can easily line up your pictures for good stop-motion flow.

All in all, a very useful program, and pretty easy to use even for a beginner."
0,"First, I need to state that I am not an uber-serious researcher of my ancestry. Nor do I need software that interfaces with Ancestry.com and has a lot of bells and whistles. In fact, I have been keeping some basic information on my family tree on some freeware software that I started using many, many years ago. It has actually served my needs very well and creates a decent, if unexciting, family tree and a standard gedcom file. I decided to try this software, as I wanted to get out of the dark ages and get on board with the latest technology. So far, I do not believe I have accomplished either very well. While I did not experience any major problems with installation that many people have, neither have I used many of the features that this software has available. So, for the average person just needing a family tree, I think this software works just fine. In fact, I would say that if you do not need any special features, you might just be better off looking for a less complex, less expensive piece of software. Since I have not used this program to interface with Ancestry.com, I am not qualified to review that portion of the software. Just to let you know, my PC is still running on Windows XP, so that is the operating system that it was intstalled on. I suggest people read and evaluate the reviews on this site, as well as other genealogy sites, before making a purchase decision on this product."

Aftershot, a specific program for RAW images, is something I really like. I usually shoot in RAW and most programs are quite picky about editing them. With Aftershot, it makes it as simple as using Picasa for simple, fast picture editing.  I found most of the controls for photo editing easy to find and figure out.  Movie editing was about as easy as most programs, a little more technical than MS Movie Editor but does so much more.

Overall, Roxio has made a very nice discount combo package that once you learn, is easy and simple to use.  Plenty of tutorials (you will need them for a little while) that guide you through.

0,"Windows 8 (W8 hereafter) is one of those ""attaboy"" or E for Effort type of deals - it looks good on the surface but after using it a while it becomes obvious something is missing or not working properly.

As something of a background I've been using Windows since the 80s DOS days.  I'm not a newbie and have owned or worked on computers running DOS, 3.x, Me, 2000, NT, XP, Vista, 7 and now 8 from the MS family.

First, let's get down to the nitty-gritty.  W8 is not a new operating system.  It's a melding (or welding) or the Windows Metro user interface (UI) from their smartphones and Windows 7.  When you boot you'll see the Metro UI first but 7 is lurking in the background.

For those unfamiliar with the Metro UI, it's a series of tiles (square or rectangular) that represent apps.  Touching or clicking these tiles opens the corresponding app.  Great for tablets or touch screens, somewhat questionable for computers.

Second, priorities and functions are clearly set.  Metro handles apps while 7 handles programs and the two don't cross in that respect.  Although MS is coming out with an Office suite that works in Metro like an app, anybody with earlier versions of that software package will notice it doesn't work in the Metro app area but does quite nicely in the Windows 7 area.

If you have no experience with apps, the best explanation I can give is that they are program wannabes - sort of like putting racing tires on a Prius.  It may look sporty but you're still not topping 80 anytime soon so don't plan on racing a real sportscar like a Porsche.

But this is where it gets confusing.  Although Metro handles apps it also creates tiles for the programs (mostly) found or installed under the 7 area.  Clicking on these tiles doesn't open the program in Metro but instead causes a flip in which 7 opens and then so does the program.

For example, installing the LibreOffice suite for Windows will create tiles in the Metro apps (one for each segment of the suite) but clicking on them means your computer must switch from the Metro interface over to 7.

Fortunately, it's relatively seamless and many won't notice it right away and it became so fast over time it's hardly apparent anymore.

Without getting into overly elaborate detail I'm going to list the pros, cons and neutrals I've found in testing W8.

Pros

* Quick boots.  I average about 25 seconds to the Metro UI but read my note in cons below about the 7 boots.

* Actually kept most of my programs intact and those that wouldn't work anymore were probably not anything I really cared about to begin with (old XP relics, mainly).

* It's cheap at the moment.  Those in possession of a recently purchased computer can get Pro for $14.99 and those using 7 on an older purchase can buy it for $40 via MS ($70 through some of the online outlets but many are offering $30 rebates via gift cards).  I believe those prices are good through January.

Cons

* While the Metro UI boots in 30 seconds or less, 7 is still grinding away in the background.  In fact, if you click on the desktop icon in Metro and flip over to 7 right after booting you'll get the usual swirling circle indicating it has another minute or so to completion.

* Horribly installation times.  Upgrades are a rather torturous 2 hours and there were times I wondered if the process had failed.  Full installations fared better at roughly 45 minutes.

* Using a laptop on battery?  The Windows 7 interface has a battery icon but Metro doesn't.  The only way to tell battery level I could see was the force my mouse to the right side and then go to Settings at which time an icon pops up; however, it disappears when your mouse moves.

* It says it will save files, docs and assorted personal items during installation but I found that to be hit or miss.  Some were easy enough to locate but others just flat disappeared.  Never did find some of my music files.

* Apps are slow to open and I do mean slow, plus many of them won't work without an active internet connection.  In some cases it takes longer for apps to open than for W8 to boot into Metro.  Go figure.

* Metro uses a horizontal scrolling (left to right instead of up and down) and if your mouse doesn't handle that you'll better get used to grabbing the scroll bar at the bottom and dragging.

* Metro didn't create tiles for roughly half of my programs even though they were still there. That's why I ended up installing the Classic Shell program (read below under Neutrals about that).

* The new Internet Explorer is a disaster.  It's slow to open and failed twice to even open it's own MS website.  That doesn't bode well.

Neutrals

* Apps are limited at this point to a few hundred and some, like Angry Birds Space, are rather pricey at $5.  Google Play this ain't although I'm sure the choices will improve over time.

* Yet other apps sort of lie.  Free to me means no charge but some are just free ""front"" apps and you have to pay to actually use them to any great degree (such as Hulu Plus which gives you a free app but wants a monthly fee to view programs).

* The Metro interface is ugly and has limited themes.  Again, I'm sure that'll change over time.

* No Start button; however, I added a freeware program called Classic Shell and it restored the Start button.

* Like those desktop gadgets for time, weather, etc?  They are no more nor can you add them. MS dropped support and instead replaced them with tiles in the Metro area.  Fat lot of good that does you when working in 7.

* Many computers users I deal with don't like having a sign-on password but W8 requires one and I haven't heard of a successful way of getting out of it right now (some online hints I've seen are somewhat suspect).

Overall I gave W8 a three star rating (because I couldn't give 2.5 stars).  If you have 7 and are satisfied, keep it.  If you can get it for the discounted $14.99 it might be a decent investment but there is a learning curve so be prepared.

Update:  A neighbor found a snafu with W8 on laptops.  When shutting down the screen will go black but DO NOT assume the computer is off.  It actually has another 15 to 20 seconds before it fully shuts off.  As my friend discovered, shutting the cover before the power and/or hard drive activity lights go out means you might be sending it to hibernation or suspend mode.  As a result, the battery is still draining since the computer didn't shut down all the way!"

So I decided to look at/edit photos from a trip to San Francisco, Carmel, and London. You can see the photos and narratives in my video.  I did some object removal, photo clean-up, color alterations, background removal, exposure setting changes, cropping, and more.

About the Fisherman's Wharf picture, where I removed the black triangle in the corner and the power cord: This was so easy to do! There are automatic tools for literally all of this. It even recreated the letters across the Fisherman's Wharf sign. Impressive!

Adjusting the RGB curve is simple.

Adding noise is easy, but looks more extreme in the program. The photos don't show the high amounts of ""noise"" that I added as much as I thought they would.

The background removal tool doesn't work too well if your background is blurry.  But in my example, it worked well (and it was very simple to use).  In my example, I added a new background to make it look like he was in a more natural environment.

My first complaint: it is so hard to find photos.  I edited the Fisherman's Wharf photo twice because I tried to move it from iPhoto to my Desktop so that I could share it. Moving it caused Photo Director to lose it. I could not find the edited version in either iPhoto or my Desktop, or, for that matter, Photo Director. It was just gone. So I had to edit it again. Now I can't find the 1st butterfly photo with the background removed.

The London photo was edited using the ""People Beautifier"" tool.  I only used a few of the features, but it is very simple and the results can be drastic.  The close-up screenshots show how  much better the picture looks with the skin tone adjusted and the environment brightened up.

So, the bottom line:
- Export your photos as soon as you're done editing them, or else good luck finding them again.
- This program has great features to automatically edit photos, but there are no automatic adjustments (e.g., contrast, tone, curves)
- This is a great, cheaper alternative to Photoshop.
- It works with a Mac. (Hurray!)
- If you are familiar with Photoshop, you will have no problem with this program.
- If you have never edited a photo in your life, this program is much more simplistic than Photoshop (and other major photo editing programs), but can do a lot of the same things.

This program is not perfect, but I no longer feel the need to go buy myself a copy of Photoshop."
1,"Great 8-port switch.  I've owned it for over a year and it remains just warm to the touch. I have several ports at a gig and several at 100FDX.  I leave everything at autonegotiate.  There were a couple times where I switched off autonegotiate on a port and a particular PC because of an intermittent link outage and I was suspecting a problem with the autonegotiate.  But in the end, both times ended up being the same RJ-45 plug at the PC end of the 60 foot CAT-5 cable.  After finally cutting it off and crimping on a new connector, my intermittent problem went away.  This was one of my gig links.  My system maxes out at 450 Mbps point-to-point so I can't test at gig speeds.  Inserting the switch did not make any difference which is good.  One time, I configured three ports in two VLANs, (i.e. port 1 tagged to VLAN 2; port 2 untagged to default VLAN; port 3 tagged to VLAN 2 and a member of the default VLAN).  I could not get it to work with my PCs but I believe my NICs were not working properly with VLAN tags because Wireshark on all three computers never showed me a tagged frame even when I ran straight cable between two PCs configured for tagged VLANs.  In any event, while going through all these configuration changes on the switch, it never locked up or acted strangely.  The unaffected ports outside my little VLAN test remained functional.  So the only gripe I have with small devices like this is that they are too light.  They are at the mercy of the weight of the cables plugged into them.  They need lead in the bottom to hold them in place.  Alrighty then."
1,"This switch was purchased for use as our primary gigabit LAN switch fabric, and it has worked as advertised out of the box. Since the model we purchased has been discontinued by 3Com, it's made it a great bargain from a price standpoint for a 48-port gigabit switch, as you can still find some new units. The web-based configuration management interface is well thought-out and easy to navigate. In our testing, we have found that the switch provides the LAN performance that we were looking for, so we are very satisfied with the purchase."
1,"I've used Turbo Tax for years and this is the first year I will not be filing a Schedule C for Many, Many Years.  This one has the investment category included and hopefully it will be comparable to the Home and Business Turbo Tax used in the past.  Turbo Tax makes life a lot simpler for me.  Each version is a little different but the past versions have been very helpful.  Hopefully this version will be the same."
0.5,"My small business doesn't require me to do too much with the software beside invoicing clients and keeping track of expenses (I do not have employees and do not have any inventory). Yet this is a really helpful product, however I am still struggling trying to differentiate between what I need and what I don't. It was easy to install and upgrade to, they do have a few features that are at additional costs and it seems that you get a good amount of pop up windows offering other of their services. To be realistic their isn't much out there that can do the same thing quickbooks does and once you master its use it is a great software."
1,"First off this software looks great on the Mac!  When I got it, I was thinking it would be just like the Windows edition, just with the traffic light buttons at the top.  I love how everything is floating (not constrained in a Windows; you have toolbar at top, tasks in the middle, and any other items float on the desktop), this is great for when you need to open other files and still view QuickBooks, since you can put the windows side by side and still see both documents (for example copying a contact from the address book to Customer List is simple since the two small windows can sit right by each other and you can just copy and paste each item).  The next great thing is the installation, like many Mac apps it was simply a drag and drop to the application folder and it was installed.  I then was able to activate with the License and Product number and register online, super simple (took about 2 minutes).  The software was easy to set up (I have used QuickBooks for Windows in the past and am familiar with the software), my only flaw is that the first time I used it closed (red exit) on the Company Home Page and the toolbar trying to close QB, but then found I had to Quit from the Dock (or Menu), when I reopened QB, nothing was their and I had to go to Company >> Company Home, and Show Company Toolbar to get it -- Just FYI, I learned that I need to Quit from the Dock or the Menu.  The program opens very quick on my computer (I am using Mac OS X Lion [10.7.2]) and I love the number indicator lights on my items to show me what I have out their at a glance (for example a red number on Invoice to show how many open invoices I have [like on the Mail App for New Mail]).  I was able to set up my accounts with just the Default settings for my industry and was able to create my item list and Customer list very easily, the Help >> Search section is great since if you are looking for a list or setting you can type it in and it will find it for you (and show you where in the menu it is, and you can open it from their).  In the box their was a paper to show you how to import Windows based QuickBooks files, however, since I used to use Simple Start (Free for Windows), I created a new company, since I wanted the full settings from the start.

Another point I want to show, is how much of an improvement the look and feel of the software is.  I love how I can view my invoices or payments or estimates just by using the info on the left and then I can scroll through them flawlessly and view live information on the invoice or go into Preview Mode and scroll through each invoice without having to open Print Preview, as well as see quick info on the customer (like Customer Info and recent transactions!).  This software has such a genuine feel to it, which just makes it perfect!  I can see everything of my business in a quick glance without having to go through lists of information and then opening and closing widows till I find the one, this is an amazing edition of QuickBooks and is just perfect for me as a freelancer!

I also want to add how great support for QuickBooks programs are!  I use QuickBooks POS at work and had the best experience setting it up with the help of our representative and the online community.  Just as I am seeing on this product with the number of Manufacture Replies, I am seeing great customer service who is trying to help customers at every point of the experience.  I have used phone support and online support for my Intuit products in the past and have never had a bad experience.  I am glad to see the Manufacture comments on other reviewers, as that shows me that Intuit is ensuring that their products are working properly and are listening to customer feedback!  And just like our POS system I know if I need help their is entire community of Intuit product users who can help me just by me posting a question or finding others with the same inquiry.

In the end this is great software for keeping up with your business, it allows me to keep track of my freelancing and easily manage my money flow, and all from my Mac!  The software works perfectly on my Mac and looks great!  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants the amazing power of QuickBooks on their Mac!"
0.5,"I got this program because while I don't have a job that requires much in the way of typing skills but I'd like to type a little faster than 29 wpm. I remember an old Mavis Beacon program from way back in the day (1999? 2001?) that had games on it that were fun to play even when not necessarily working on typing skills but there's no way a program that old would load on my current computer. Having resisted change, I'm (still) using Windows Vista on my 2008 laptop. Initially I thought the bugginess was due to my older system, but the information does state it works with Vista and apparently, others have also had that issue. I made sure to shut down other programs as was suggested and still had issues, but then I shut off the voice entirely and haven't had problems since.

While I am disappointed to say there are no games anymore I am learning to type, and I don't just mean faster. I never learned finger placement or keys and that has always been what slowed me down, having to look at the keys instead of focus on seeing or hearing what I needed to be typing. I have gone from 29 wpm to 35 wpm and I'm still working with it, but it looks like this program will help me get there.  Since I don't need typing skills very badly my goal is simply to just about double my current speed to about 55-60 wpm.  For my purposes, it works pretty well.

This is a very basic program that can help a novice or beginner learn and/or improve their typing skills, but I'm not sure how much appeal it would have for someone who can already type 60 wpm or more and really wants to get to a secretarial speed. You may have to be single-minded and determined because it doesn't offer any kind of entertainment, and I can't see any appeal for children.  I rated it 4 stars because it works for me and serves my purposes."

0.5,"As a whole, version 8 is a fantastic Anime software program.  Those who are familiar with Anime software are going to highly enjoy it, it is packed with easy-to-use features that make it well worth the purchase and that drastically cut the production time down. The character wizard is awesome.
Those who are not familiar and are picking this program up for the first time will need patience because there is very little printed documentation and while the quick start tutorial is detailed and very helpful, it is also pdf and 51 pages so printing it is a hassle.  The other glitch that I ran into (Windows version, using on Windows 7) is that the welcome tutorial screen comes up each time I start the program, even though I keep clicking ""don't show this again"".
Affordable, fun, well-laid out tools, great value for all the features it includes."
0.5,"First, a little bit about me. I'm a writer, and although my spelling and typing are pretty good, I've been using Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium for the PC for years. It reads back what I wrote, which helps me catch typos and repeated words that my eyes alone might miss. Over the years, it's gotten better and better.

My dyslexic husband, though, prefers to work on our Mac, and he prefers to have me handle his editing needs. After all, what's the point of being married to a writer if you can't have her check your spelling, grammar, punctuation, and general writing style? He has an iPhone, too, and I've seen him struggle with Siri, whose voice recognition capabilities are a joke compared to my Android's.  So I got this software for him, because... Well, I'm tired of doing something for him when he should be able to do it himself, with the help of a little software.

Dragon Dictate for the Mac is a lot better than Siri at recognizing his voice. There's no question about that. But it doesn't hold a candle to the latest version of Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium that I'm using on my PC. To be honest, part of it does seem to be, well, him. My husband just can't seem to find a voice-recognition program that understands him. I mean, I tried Dragon Dictate, and it seemed to work okay, though not great. I'd say the accuracy with a good headset was about 92%. (By comparison, I'd give Siri a 40% and DNS Premium for the PC a 98%). For him, though, the accuracy was more like 75% with Dictate and maybe 80% with DNS Premium. Maybe it's his English accent. Maybe it's that he sort of starts and stops when he speaks. Maybe it's that he doesn't speak at an even level. I don't know. So he's decided to stick with his old system, meaning me. None of us want to be replaced by computers, but when it comes to some things... It would have been nice. I could have spent more time on my own writing.

So I like Dragon Dictate for the Mac. It's head and shoulders above the competition when it comes to voice recognition for the Mac. But I don't love it the way I love DNS Premium for the PC. It still has a way to go."

1,"My 10 year old girl and 13 year old boy had to be pulled off the computer after playing this for 5 hours straight (yeh, I know that is too long but I was working and getting so much done!).  They did not fight the entire time they played the game.  I could hear them laughing and encouraging each other to build higher (only one can play at at time).
They told me it reminded them of a combination of Zoombinis and Crazy Action Contraptions but was more fun.

Highly recommend if you need a little time to yourself without too much guilt."

1,"If you can't afford a Router (hardware) then use this software instead.

Although MSWIN XP has its own Firewall you would do better to turn it off, go to the `Zonelabs' website, download the Free version of Zonealarm, install it and give it a go. Study it for an evening and see how many access attempts there are on your computer. I promise - you will never go back from using this great firewall. Go to the Gibson Research Corporation on the internet and test your systems vulnerability using the software on that site - all free. Now if you want to make the next leap by having a more sophisticated version of Zonealarm then go Pro with this one. The pro version offers the following additions to the free version.

- An improved approval program for Internet Access.

- Advanced security controls.

- Automatically stops pop-up ads so you can surf in peace.

- Prevents personal data from leaving your computer without permission.

- Checks for and deletes adware cookies.

- Blocks adware cookies but allows cookies from trusted sites.

- Protects your privacy and improves PC performance.

- Tracks hacker attempts and anonymously reports offenders to their ISPs.

- Monitors outgoing email and halts messages with potential viruses.

Now as an all in one tool you could also opt for the ZoneAlarm Security Suite that gives you an anti-virus program to top it all off, so as an all in one security system this really is a great solution for the home user. If you stick with the free version make sure to also use adaware and AVG, both free anti-ad/anti-virus software packages that help complement the free version but the all in one Security Suite is still you best buy.

In Short, this is an essential security product."
0.5,This Trend Micro Titanium Antivirus+ worked very well. Trend Micro has been one of our go too internet security providers for years and they are still pretty good. It dosent slow down any of our Pc's we have Trend on Tablets as well. I can think of no viruses/spy ware issues even with some of th systems being used on not the safest avenues. This is good basic starter software.
1,"I have been using the Corel PaintShop Pro software since its earliest version and it is still the main photo-editing software I use everyday among other photo-editing software including the PhotoShop. What I like about the Corel PaintShop Pro software are its ease of use and the wealth of features for general quick /easy and the more advanced photo editing.

Here are some of the features I use most often for quick editing :

- smart photo fix : allows a 1-click photo enhancement with real time review and adjustment to our liking
- various photo brushes (clone brush, scratch remover etc) for quick touch-up of the photos
- white balance adjustment for the perfect color balancing
- skin smoothing which makes us look years younger

The software comes with a wealth of advanced features including layering, masking, vector objects, stack filters, raw processing and a variety of photo effects.

This latest version is noticeably faster including the program start-up and the more CPU intensive tasks like skin smoothing and such. It also comes with new features such as magic move which allows us to move an object with an intelligent algorithm to fill the background. There are also bonus CDs including the Perfect Effects, Corel AfterShot, Perfectly Clear SE, and creative collection which enhance our capabilities for photo editing.

For those who are looking a reasonably priced photo editing software with easy-to-use interface and advanced features, this is one to consider."
0,"I bought norton 360 earlier this year as an upgrade when my subscription for norton internet security was about to expire, on a machine with 256mb memory, xp pro, with iexplorer 7.0 as my browser. Almost immediately after installation, the system when into catatonia. In order to get anything resembling response time, I had to fall back to iexplorer 6.0. Still, screen changes within a website exceeding one minute were not unusual.

I had to leave the system on constantly because after shut down or to reboot would consume anywhere from 15 minutes to over 1/2 hour. I was also disappointed to discover this ""upgrade"" meant sacrificing all of the functionality I had come to appreciate with Norton systemworks since the first action that is performed in installation is wiping out that product, not to mention the initial loss of any spam filtering.

But, let's fast forward to the present, after a full system replacement with two gig core2 duo running at 800mhz,vista ultimate and iexplorer 7.0... Norton 360 works like a dream, performing all the advertised background functions without any intervention, although it must be acknowledged I do not use the automated off site backup feature.

Bottomline, If you have over 1gig of memory and a fast processor, this product isn't that bad."
-1,"This is nothing more than a faster booting Vista.  Internet Explorer still sucks hard, freezes and is just plain useless.  The OS itself is still rather slow compared to any mac os, still no more secure than XP, same UI issues as Vista with a few new ones, and is still just as annoying to use.  The price bothers me too because after the epic fail that was Vista this so called *upgrade* should have been free or sold the way Apple sold Snow Leopard for 30 bucks which is reasonable for a mod or simple upgrade tweak.  Apple acknowledged that SL was an upgrade patch with tweaks to fix issues in Leopard not a new OS. Windows 7 is the same exact thing, just a patch for Vista to make it boot faster, with a new coat of paint........so why does microsoft need to double dip and charge consumers 100-200+ dollars for it.  After Vista Microsoft should have been ordered by law to make this ""improvement"" free or hold them at gunpoint and make them fix their slow, bloated, unreliable, crap OS in the first place.  The only thing Windows is good for is playing games which it does right half the time, can't wait until Mac gets a games licence then I can deleted my Windows 7 boot camp partition."
1,On a voyage of discovery working out it's potential. It delivers what is supposed to deliver so I am quite satisfied.
0.5,"Norton is a good add-on security standard for computers or other devices.  It is not as intrusive as McAfee.  I would recommend it over other security service providers.

In a world where computer security is becoming more online news, using Norton will give you a bit more peace of mind.  Every computer should have at least on security service installed.  And yes, you do have to download the software but that is better than having a disk you may lose.

The pricing is high for one device when you can get a license for five or ten devices for just a little more.  I would recommend going with a multiple device license instead of just one since it can be used on mobile devices as well.

Recommended!"

0.5,"The Pinnacle series has always sought to be the ""premium"" of the Corel family. Lots of features, extras, and massive platform to do almost any home or semi-pro project. The problems with previous Pinnacle is the lack of multithread and 64 bit integration, and choppy rendering during the editing process. The Pinnacle 18 has 64 bit architecture and utilizes your computer's juice to it's fullest potential.

Installation - Took far too long. 30 minutes for installation in this optimized day in age? A non-factor, but something worth noting.

Interface-  Intuitive, easy to drag and drop, cut, selecting frames.

Rending Capability - While it is built for CUDA (Nvidia Graphics cards), my AMD Radeon card still was able to lend some juice to rendering.

Editing - Drag and drop, snip snip, import video. Relatively easy to pick up. Not being able to just drag a video from the outside is annoying. I have to import the video into the Pinnacle ecosystem before playing with it. The editing tool for video is superb. Change lighting, exposure, overlay image or text - this is like photoshop/lightroom for video editing.

Live Screen Capture - Simply a win. No more searching for that right screen capture software. Integrated, easy to use, spectacular convenience.

What I love is that recording both the video and audio (program sounds) is seamless. Not many recording programs provide this feature. Usually, you would need to use an external recording device to overlay any audio.

Features and extras - My golly. Royalty free soundtracks, endless list of transitions and effects, countless plugins. I personally don't need them all, but you will probably find a diamond in the bucket. It can be quite a headache to surf through all those transitions and effects. Look through them all thoroughly a couple times, bookmark your favorites, and save yourself time in your video editing regime.

The Pinnacle Studio 18 jumped leaps in and bounds and showed promise with the revamped 64 bit architecture and usual plethora of features. It is far from perfect, but it does give you all the tools for home or semi-pro production. If you want to cut the crap (plugins, extras), and you do like the Pinnacle Studio's ease of use, already solid collection of transitions and effects, go with the Pinnacle regular or plus versions.

1,Use it every year. works great for me.
1,EXCELLENT
1,Ok
0.5,NOrton still has it. The 360 for 2009 has everything you need to protect your computer without additional add ons. It's no different than McAfee's total protection. BUT...Norton has a wider user base which means you can find supported programs with ease. Many users have problems with McAfee's compatablility with some Vista programs.  Norton is your best bet for ease of use with other programs.
1,"Unit came used, but in fine condition. Seems to be working well. I have not tried any advanced functionality as I just got a null-modem cable to get into that part."
0.5,"I usually assemble my own PCs, but this spring, I decided to gamble on a factory machine. Being a gamer and an artist, I wanted a good performance rig festooned with removable storage ports and cable jacks. So I picked up an HP Media Center and discovered Windows Vista.

Vista Home Premium is to Windows XP as XP was to the Windows 9x series. In other words, I think it's a leap: one of Microsoft's most radical changes in interface, capability, and security that I've experienced. And I've laid my hands on almost every Windows OS since 1992.

Enough so that I find Vista to be superfluous despite its changes. XP users in particular need not apply (an upgrade that is, yuck yuck!).  But for anybody who's looking to finally replace that trusty old copy of 98 Second Edition, or who wants to jump on the multiprocessor, dual video card, high-def graphic experience, then this is the system for you. Just beware--here there be bugs and compatibility issues.

->DOWN TO DETAILS<-

Despite all my talk about big leaps, there is nothing that Vista does that XP users can't do without. Home Premium bundles a number of apps `n' applets that XP must apply separately, but nevertheless is able to apply. Otherwise, the remaining differences are pretty looking, but pretty useless.

>Aeroplane and Horsepower

Such as a new ""glass"" interface called Aero. Everything about it, including the cute sidebar, the marble Start button, and fancy-pants window switching, windows thumbnail, and windows sizing effects--looks better than the ""Fisher Price"" XP. Or any previous version of Windows, for that matter. Vista runs simple effects, such as color-coding file names to indicate a compressed file. And more complex effects: hover the mouse pointer over a program in the taskbar, and a cute little thumbnail screenshot pops up; while hitting the ""switch window"" button in the quick launch box will stack full size pics of your open programs to sort through.

This interface is one of the shallow leaps from XP. It doesn't have much utility but it sure looks like it needs hardware to run. Except Aero ran just fine on my low-range, low powered graphics card installed by the factory: an NVIDIA OEM 7500 LE. And I have confirmed that it will run, if a bit sluggishly, on a single gig of RAM with a modest dual-core processor. Vista also comes preloaded with Direct X 10, which itself is supposed to be a revolution in graphics processing. Since I have no DX10 programs other than Vista, I can't tell you whether this matters or not.

>Stability

What might matter to the performance minded user: stability. I've only used Vista for a couple of months, but I have suffered no OS crashes or freezes. Unlike XP which, while the most stable Windows of its time, still bugged out on me at least once a month. Individual programs still crash or fail to respond--notably AOL and Word 2007. Also, closing a program sometimes triggers a ""Stopped Working"" error message, but I detect no actual harm and I can load such a program right back up. So far Vista has taken every peripheral, drive, and PC card I've thrown at it. On a down note, VHP is so big that a Norton virus scan or disk defrag takes roughly twice as long as it did in XP.

Update 15 AUG 2007: After installing my PSU and graphic card, I noticed system hangs at startup. These seem to be resolved after a recent update. Also, the aforementioned app crashes have been resolved by updates.

Now, in performance, I include the improved power options. Three pre-set states exist: from high-performance/low-savings, to a balanced system, to energy efficiency but low performance. Additionally, the low-power states of previous Windows have been combined in a newish ""Sleep"" mode. According to my documentation, putting the computer into Sleep mode is actually preferable to shutting down the system every night, presumably because Vista runs a number of maintenance programs when I am not looking. These power settings integrate with my monitor's own energy program, incidentally.

>Security

Speaking of management, Vista includes User Account Controls, which basically asks your permission every...single...time...you attempt to install a program, uninstall a program, or run any sort of program which significantly affects the performance of Windows. As an XP veteran myself, I just turn this annoying feature off, since there is currently no scalability to this control (that is, I can't order it what to watch and what to ignore). Vista also has a detailed file sharing security system, to the extent that even an Administrator account can be denied permission to move that Metallica MP3 from your Download folder to your KigAzz Musik folder. No, really, it is that buggy and intrusive.

>Bells n Whistles

Vista also comes preloaded with its own firewall, calendars, news tickers, and system monitors that XP users can separately plug in. Annoyingly, Vista itself has no CPU temperature widget--I have to go into my BIOS for that.

What I think is more useful are all the inherent, if generic, multimedia applications. Vista Home Premium supports HD DVD and HDTV. And users can access their media, including music and video files as well as television, through a Windows Media Center interface. VHP includes generic video capture capability, generic movie editing, generic DVD home movie burning, generic picture gallery, and of course, those old stalwarts, Paint and Sound Recorder (Note that the capabilities of Sound Recorder have been greatly reduced, to the point that in premium it can only record in .wma format and with no onboard editing or sound effect capability). The interface itself is reorganized to include more recognition for gamers. All of your games can be found in a dedicated tab within the Start menu.

Speaking of gamers, Vista is supposed to support games in other ways as well. There's the new Games for Windows protocol, which I really don't know much about, in addition to the graphics support. DX10, incidentally, includes a number of back-compatible Direct3D APIs to support XP-era programs. Games like *Oblivion* run like a dream, while the infamous audio stutter bug of *Half-Life 2* is actually worse than on my XP rig.

Keep in mind also that many new hardware devices still support XP. My new NIVIDA 8600 GTS, for example, includes DX9.0c and supports such systems, even though it is a DX10 card.

->SEND OUT THE BUGS<-

Unfortunately, none of this seems to be enough for *Max Payne* and *Max Payne 2*, which I have been unable to get going on VHP. And that leads me to the compatibility issues. The Windows Upgrade Advisor utility isn't entirely accurate about what software will run well in Vista. I had to replace all of my Norton Software, and I was disgusted to discover that the 2007 edition of SystemWorks still wasn't Vista compatible! And yet, my ancient copy of Adobe Photoshop LE 5.0 functions well enough. My old Canon Zoombrowser has some graphic issues with the buttons, but the pictures themselves appear just fine.

Not so fine are some media limitations. Home Premium includes Windows Media Player 11. This program will write album tags to newly ripped .WAV files. However, old .WAV files cannot be tagged, and will be permanently lumped together under the ""Unknown Album"" section. Because officially, WMP 11 does not support metadata for WAV, just .wma and MP3. Even though it can write in .WAV format. That's just stupid.

Plus, I hate the fact that burning a CD in WMP continues to automatically insert a pause between tracks. Apparently, Bill Gates has never heard a music album that segues, such as almost everything ever published by Frank Zappa and Trent Reznor.

VHP also has some bug issues. As confirmed on the Microsoft support site, wakening the computer from a low-power state causes digital audio drivers to malfunction. In my case, it fills my speakers with static. Three Windows Updates, including the newest one posted on 10 July 2007, have not solved this problem. I found two solutions on my own:

*I can reboot, which is annoying whenever I need to get back on the computer after an absence, such as sleeping, eating, and otherwise living my life.

*Or I can stop using digital audio altogether. Specifically by running analog cables from the speaker outputs of my computer to the multichannel inputs of my receiver, and then telling my computer's sound manager to run speaker audio as the default device. Since *Half-Life 2* only supports analog surround sound anyways, this is no real loss. Except I think it is stupid that a game will happily use stereo cables to support my 5.1 setup, but refuses to use my digital cable for anything except stereo!

->THE BOTTOM LINE<-

Vista is ideal for some and excessive for others.

XP with SP2 is still a current and capable OS, with a third service pack on the way. Microsoft will continue mainstream support until about 2009. So after spending hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on XP compatible software, you might as well get your money's worth and keep using it. Especially since Vista's successor is already in the works, XP users can safely wait a couple more years.

This is true even for security-minded users. The new account restrictions are appropriate for an actual network that can be accessed by multiple people. You will still need a third party anti-virus and spyware program. For everybody else, XP with Service Pack 2 and regular updates will protect your Jenna Jameson pics and household budgets just fine.

Likewise, those who are serious about media will not need Vista's limited programs. You `ll be looking for more capable products from third party vendors, such as Nero, Paint Shop Pro, or Final Cut. Bleeding-edge gamers and graphic artists will likely appreciate the increased graphics capability, especially since a handful of DX10 games are due this fall, but like physics cards, I wouldn't consider this a must-have tech until 2008.

However, those who are buying their first computer, or who need to replace a much older OS, will benefit from the change in just about every respect: from stability to out-of-the-box capability. You will lose support for some old programs, especially those written before 2002, but those probably need to be replaced anyways. Vista also requires considerably more memory and hard drive space, so those running an older OS are probably in a position to require a hardware upgrade as well.

Finally, Vista Home Premium is ideal for those who want to get their 21st Century Geek on, especially when coupled with a multimedia, high-framerate, high-def death rig. Rrrr! I'm a truck! (Sorry, I just had to throw in a Wildman Fisher reference).

My Specs: PCIe x 16 SATA mobo, Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 2.4 Ghz; 3 GB of PC2 5300 SDRAM, and a 256 MB  DX10 compatible video card, running off a 500w PSU (This is a mid range PC by today's gaming standards, but it still kicks it out)."
1,"I first got into the Nancy Drew series when I was 12 (almost four years ago) when I stumbled upon a demo online of this exact game; It was fate I tell you :D! While I might be the one of the rare guys that play Nancy Drew instead of something like Call of Duty, everyone should give these games a chances, especially this one.

Being a relatively old nancy drew game, some may consider it unfair to compare this game to newer ones. But, this game can go toe to toe with some newer nancy drew games and beat them. Here's why:

Story: 8/10. Definitely not the most interesting storyline of the series by a long shot, but the orca's situation of having people fight over what to do with it was surprisingly intriguing to follow. By the end, I was dying to know it's fate.

Graphics: 7.5/10. For a relatively early nancy drew game, the graphics are great for that time period. They obviously can't really hold a candle to the new games (Ransom of the Seven Ships is coastal too and is GORGEOUS). The game looks a bit grey and dull by the boat, but that's probably what HERInteractive was aiming for. Interiors like the diner and Whale World look great.

Characters: 8/10. The characters were pretty tame in this game, but were distinct in themselves. You have the normal number of suspects (3-5) that each have their own personalities without going over the top. None of them are afraid to voice their opinions on what should be done about the orca, which to me was nice to see.

Puzzles: 8.5/10. Some left me clueless, and I had to use walkthroughs from time to time, but they were puzzles that weren't too easy, and weren't too difficult either. Some games in the series have less puzzles and more chores and jobs. Fortunately, that's not this game.

Activities: 8.5/10. Whale World was a great part of the game, and actually educated me about the ocean, which I didn't even realize until after I was finished with the game. The diner was somewhat charming, and the orca at the end was adorable.

Ending: 9/10. Some games end with a large chase with the culprit, but in this one it's a lot of sleuthing and catching the culprit is really satisfying. No more about it though, I'd hate to ruin it.

Total (averaged): 8.25 out of 10, rounded to....

8/10.

I highly recommend this game if you don't already have it, it's probably my second favorite one in the series (behind ""Secrets of the Old Clock."")."

1,"Attached the antenna to a linksys pci card.  Increased a weak and unstable 2 bar signal to a rock solid 5 bar between two buildings about 250 ft. apart.  Can watch videos and TV, listen to music, etc. with no problems.  Highly recommend."
-0.5,I now wish I simply went with Boot Camp.  This product has some issues and one constantly gets urgent notifications to pay up for a download of a more recent release.
0.5,"Having played almost every game in the Nancy Drew PC series (missing SAW and FIN), I know that each game has a certain atmosphere in it; Some are more dark and murky (Castle Malloy comes to mind), some are very light and whimsical while still being a mystery (Secret of the Old Clock?), and some have a nicely balanced mixture of the two (Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake is a good example). Although I usually like the dark ones the least, something about this game was very gravitational. When I first started it, little did I know that not only I'd actually like it even a little, but I'd write a somewhat decent review on it.

Story: 7.5/10. Orginially, Nancy shows up at Blackmoor Manor, a massive mansion in England, to find out what is wrong with newlywed Linda Penvellyn, who won't show her face or communicate with anyone, with the exception of a few words. Upon Nancy's arrival, weird things start happening fast, and it's clear that there's either a supernatual being in the residency, or someone really doesn't want Nancy there. The Penvellyn family is HUGE, and it was considerably fascinating to uncover more and more history.

Graphics/Setting: 7.5/10. The characters are still robotic at this point in the series, but they're slowly improving. Since you stay indoors the whole time (which was a negative aspect for me), you got to really see the detail in the mansion, but boy is there a lot. The manor makes you feel very small, and it's full of a lot of surprises and secrets waiting to be uncovered.

Characters: 7/10. The characters were considerably good this time around. To name a few, there's the intentionally nice but slightly irritating girl Jane, the hired author, Nigel who's writing a Penvellyn memoir, and Mrs. Drake, a strict and uptight lady. There's also Loulou the parrot, who's helpful and funny, but annoying at times.

Puzzles: 7/10. Even though I had to use a walkthrough for almost all of the puzzles, they still took a long time to get done. They really got you to think, but to the point where you're cranium hurt! I think this game sort of over-did the puzzles because they're soooo many. This isn't called the hardest Nancy Drew game for nothing.

Activities: 5/10. There isn't anything really to do outside of the story progression, which I found very dissapointing. I realize that the point of these games is to sleuth and solve mysteries, but fun activities are a priority in my book, and this game just didn't have any.

Ending: 7/10. Maybe the most simple ending yet in the series. Somewhat surprising as well.

Total: 7.33, rounded to the final score of....

7.5/10.

While I may be a tad biased because I don't usually enjoy the darker games, this game does deserve a purchase for many Nancy Drew PC fans, but I'd go with something else for now."
0,"I like this program - in general - much more than Turbo Tax because it installs fully the first time without ""problems"" and it is very easy to use!
However - for Vermont, where there is a property tax ""prebate"" that residents must know to apply for...TaxCut does not have the forms one needs AND they do not tell you you need the forms.  SO - I would never  get the $550 ""prebate"" that I was entitled to this year, except that I knew about it from previous tax filings.
Also, it bothers me that in order to get my ""prebate"" I had to fill out downloaded forms by hand after searching for needed information in my files and using a calculator to get some needed totals.  To me, this is NOT what I should have to do after spending over $65 for a Fed./State/e-filing program!!!
Besides, if Turbo Tax can fill out these forms automatically and have these same forms in its State of Vermont Tax Program - what is wrong with TaxCut doing the same thing???  (I chatted online with TaxCut's customer support about this problem and they told me (a week ago) that there would be no updates to their Vermont program and that they ""do not include all needed forms"" in their program.)
NOW, wouldn't you think it is important to know about and be able to file forms HS-122 and HS-144 when you might get $500 or more back for submitting them?
What does this say about TaxCut and their completeness of tax preparation software?
What does this say about TaxCut's concern for their customers????
It tells ME that I need to go back to Turbo Tax next year - even with its installation problems - and save myself the hassle of handwriting information on self-downloaded and self-printed forms and not have to print an envelope and stamp it -- from now on!!
I was very disappointed with TaxCut and it's ""help.""
On-Line filing was easy and quick."
1,One of few that have 8 ports.  It was a great price.  It worked right away and got our system up in running in no time.
-1,"I invest at Betterment. COM, where I made two sales and once changed my stock/bond percentages. To me that was 3 transactions, but to H&R Block  and the IRS it's at least sixty, maybe a hundred. The program downloads that information from Betterment -- no problem! But then it FORCES me to ""confirm"" every one of them individually. That means clicking ""edit"" next to each one that has an exclamation point (all of them) and click ""Next"" anywhere from two to five times, depending.

There's no effin' way I can actually CONFIRM all those details -- I have to trust Betterment. But H&R Block does not, so it will take an hour or two to do what's supposed to be ""automatic"". All of this for a total of $97 in capital gains and $5 in disallowed short sales.

What a load.

(Added comments below)

The result was MUCH WORSE than I thought -- 29 pages x 12 transactions per page on Schedule D and 19 pages x 14 per page on form 8949 -- for a total of close to 600 entries.

After ""confirming"" each transaction, H&R Block brought me back to the top of the list, where I had to scroll down, down, down, down, down (yawn), down, down, down to find a transaction not yet ""confirmed"". This made an annoying situation even worse.

There should have been just ONE check box to confirm ALL these downloaded transactions at once."
1,"I can't even begin to tell you how much I love Windows XP.  Why?  Because when people used to have computer problems with Windows 95,98, and ME, I was always first on everyone's list to come fix their computer problems.  It was fun at first, but then I was really sick of it.  When XP came out, I recommended to all those people to get XP.  Now, NO ONE has called me since with a computer problem.  That shows you how wonderful this operating system is.  XP is not perfect; but it works well enough to keep the average computer user happy with the condition of their computer. It is virtually idiot proof and it is very difficult to 'mess it up'.  The system restore function is a big plus.  Also, Windows XP keeps your system files from being corrupted by viruses by not allowing unauthorized access to the files.  I'm not saying that it's virus-proof, but much more secure than previous Windows versions.  The only downside to XP is that some computer games don't seem to work good with it unless they were made compatible with XP."

1,"This is a great little switch. I replaced a big 24 port gig switch with this to save some money on power and to reduce the amount of heat generated by my network gear in my home office. It runs cool and is part of their new ""green"" switch line that reduces power consumption in a number of ways. It does everything I expect higher end web-managed switches to do, and is extremely affordable. I like that 3Com has redesigned this line to have flat case tops instead of the rounded tops they used to have (no more need for the extra bracket in order to put something on top of it). Make sure that you upgrade the firmware on this switch right out of the box before doing ANYTHING else; there's a bug in the shipped firmware that will brick the switch when you set the password and you'll have to console into it to recover otherwise. The new firmware fixes that."

I went to the TurboTax support site for help.  The information they provided did not solve the problem and the only available next step was to submit my email address.  The Quicken reply message was not helpful and only stated that they will email me when they have a solution to the problem.  Cold comfort for someone who bought the product that is supposed to be Vista compatible.  Shame on you, Quicken!

FYI...I installed it on Windows XP without any problem eventhough it did take quite a long time for the installation.  So, if you have Vista, perhaps you should find another tax prep product."

0,"I obtained a $15 upgrade license to Windows 8 Pro more than a year ago, when I purchased my desktop computer.  I was one of the early adopters of Windows 8, but immediately regretted it due to major incompatibility and usability problems, so I went and reverted back to Windows 7.  At that time, I felt it was too early to write a fair review.  I mean, for me it was a major screw up from Microsoft, but I also felt that MS had a point in producing a touch-screen oriented OS, and that I should probably wait and see if this actually was the way to go in the near future.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and stood down from blasting them with a negative review.
A year later comes Windows 8.1, claiming adjustments were implemented for the non-touch-screen user base, in an attempt to convince more people into adopting their new OS platform.
Windows 8.1 is free for Windows 8 users, so I decided to give it another chance.  I figured, why waste all of $15 dollars on a new OS and not take advantage of this redeeming opportunity? So here's how it went.

Upgrade process:

*** Edit: Forgot to mention the upgrade path for Windows 8.1.  You upgrade from Windows 7, to Windows 8, from 32 bit to 32 bit and 64 bit to 64 bit.  Going from 32 to 64 bit requires a full/fresh install (it wipes documents, programs, etc.), not an upgrade.  Also, you can't upgrade from Win 7 64-bit to Win 8 32-bit.  Once you upgrade to Windows 8, you can upgrade to 8.1 by downloading the point release in the Microsoft Store, available as a tile icon on the Windows 8 new Metro desktop.  The 8.1 download will be available only after you have applied all critical Windows 8 post-upgrade fixes.  It may take a few restarts until you get all Windows 8 updates.  If you plan to update directly from Win 7 to Win 8.1, you will require a full/fresh install, it is also not part of the upgrade path.  end Edit ***

Upgrade assistant displayed a report with potential application compatibility issues.
Not all of the installed applications are scanned during this process, only those apps that Microsoft has registered on their database.  You have to cross your fingers for other applications on your system to work with Windows 8.1.  I suggest some investigative work prior to committing to the upgrade process, especially if one of those unreported apps is considered critical for you.
The initial stages of the upgrade show you the incompatible applications and drivers for Windows 8.  This was scary at first, because one of the apps was the actual antivirus software, which ironically is their own MS Security Essentials. The actual reason for the message is that Windows 8 includes its own AV software integrated with the OS called Windows Defender. Security Essentials is now a pre Windows 8 product.
The other two incompatible applications were the Blue Tooth and USB 3.0 controllers.  Later after the upgrade I found out that these were actually replaced with Windows 8.1 versions, but this is not clearly explained during the upgrade; at that point they were just incompatible, okay? You figure it out.  It felt a little uncomfortable, sitting in front of your screen contemplating whether these incompatibilities will impact your upgrade or not.  I could imagine a non-technical user hitting Esc or Cancel immediately after seeing this.  I saw this as a challenge, I dared Windows 8.1 to mess with my working Windows 7 setup, so I followed their directions to uninstall Security Essentials and the USB and Bluetooth drivers and continue faithfully (blindly)with the process.  After that, a Steam game was reported as incompatible and two others required patches supposedly available from their developers.  Fortunately in this case, all the games worked fine after the upgrade was completed (with all Windows updates applied).
The actual upgrade took approximately two hours or so (including the initial download).  It actually took longer to apply the Windows updates after the actual upgrade.  In total, it took approximately 3.5 hrs to finish the entire upgrade, and most of this time was spent ""watching paint dry"".

Post upgrade issues (One major and one minor issue):

Major issue - Higher than normal CPU usage with and idle computer and abnormally high CPU temperatures (55C - 60C).  After some investigation, it was an Intel Storage Controller driver compatibility issue.  Replacing the Windows driver with the PC manufacturer's version made this issue go away.  If it wasn't for a small CPU temperature app (Speed Fan) I wouldn't have discovered the problem with who knows what future consequences.

Minor issue - A third party app that was not displayed on the Windows compatibility report, no longer works with Windows 8.1.  It was not a big deal for me because the software developer has not upgraded this software for almost two years now anyway (DarkBasic Pro).

Personal gripes:

- The new Metro interface - It's designed for touch screen devices, I have a Desktop.  Isn't it possible to write a piece of code to detect whether or not you have a touch screen device and adjust the Metro desktop accordingly?

- Windows button - It's there, but it does not work as I believe many of us were expecting it to work, to give us the familiar Start menu with All Programs.  You still have to use the metro interface to search or browse for your programs.  You'll have to get used to it.  On the positive side, the shortcut to common system options when you right click the Windows icons is a nice plus.

- File History - There is no Backup and Restore anymore.  It seems that with every Windows upgrade, a key functionality is removed from this important component.  From XP to Win 7 you lost the ability to backup to network drives, unless you purchased the Ultimate edition. Windows 8.1 replaced Backup and Restore with File History, which is limited to backing up files located in Documents, Music, Video, Desktop and Pictures folders.  You are no longer able to customize the backup to save files from other folder on your computer.  You will have to relocate folders into any of the valid backup folders.  It still saves backups on external drives only.  Shared drives or even Sky Drive are not backup options.
The automated backup occurs a few times during the day.  You can backup on demand, but have no control of the automated backup frequency.  The backup format is different than the format used in Windows 7.  If you used to have a backup in Windows 7 format, now you have two different sets of backups on the same drive.

- Minor gripe, it feels redundant having application shortcuts on your regular Desktop and your Metro desktop.

Pluses

- The Sports tile - It's nice to have an option to select favorite team news. The results, standings, and stats information is always up to date and quickly available.
- The News tile was awesome until it stopped working...
- In Metro, the option to search programs organized by most commonly used is very convenient
- I still have my Desktop and shortcuts.
- Windows boots a little faster and it handles CPU cycles very well.  Components are running cool and efficient.

Current issues

- News tile opens and closes and does not display news.  Currently I can't read news, although I can see the headline updates on the actual tile icon.

- The lock screen actually lives up to its name.  After a while of inactivity (haven't nailed the actual time it takes before the system locks up), the lock screen remains there and you can't get past it to the logon.  The mouse cursor icon moves, and the keyboard is responding (can see Caps lock light switching on and off) but it's not possible to get to the actual log on screen. Windows does not respond to Ctrl-Alt-Del, esc keys, mouse clicks, space bar or any key combination. The only solution is to power down, and then be greeted with a message that the computer did not shutdown cleanly during power up.

- Sky Drive - Stopped working the first day after I cancelled a large file upload.  There's an error message, but no option to resolve the issue.  The message shows up every time I open Sky drive, and have not been able to delete or add any more files ever since, and the message cannot be deleted. The only way to use Sky Drive is by using the ol' regular web browser method.

- File Search - For some reason it takes forever to open .jpg files directly from the search results, no matter how small the file size is.  You have to select the option to open file location and then click on the file within File Explorer to get a quick response.  This issue does not happen with videos, Word documents, or PDFs.

Conclusion
- It will probably take some time to get all the issues corrected. In my case, they are not really critical issues, but they are nonetheless annoying and make you feel like
Microsoft again gave more importance to general compatibility than to stability and usability.

- It still seems to me that Microsoft is still insisting on forcing people to adopt the touch screen technologies with the Metro interface.  I insist it's still too early for that and Microsoft should adjust their OS's to accommodate to their user demands not the other way around.

- It was a rocky start, but I'm okay with the current application compatibility.  As long as I can play my Steam games and use my personal finance apps, I'm a happy camper.
It's a keeper, for now just because I feel too lazy to go through a factory reset back to Windows 7.  Three stars for now.  I'll keep you posted..."

0.5,"This is the product key and download instructions for MS Office Home and Business 2016. There are no DVD's or CD's. As with most software these days, you will download it from the web and register it with Microsoft to install. It works better on more recent version, e.g. Windows 10, than on older versions. This version has more integration with ""the cloud"", some new help features, and is a traditional license (not a subscription) which I think is a big plus for most people.

Although you must have a MS account to install (most people using Windows 10 will already have one), the software will run stand-alone on your PC without requiring you to be connect ""on-line"" with MS. So this is pretty much in line with older traditional versions of MS Office, a good thing. Included are Excel, Word, Powerpoint (the big three) as well as Outlook and OneNote.  For the most part, these all work as expected. Users of earlier versions will be right at home.

Nothing especially grand about the new edition that I can see, so far, although there are some new features and minor improvements. For the money, it's a good deal if you are a *new* user for this product.  If you have one of the old products, you might as well stick with that, in my opinion.

I think the price is reasonable, you get a lot for the money.  If you already have an older version, it may not be worth upgrading. That said, this is a mature and very capable software suite, so a good value and very useful."

I have been a TT user for 15 years and a beta tester several times.  The product itself is pretty good but the greed at Intuit is unbearable. In 2005, TT eliminated the free e-file coupon and raised the price. Now in 2008, TT again raises the price, charges for 1 e-file (weather you use it or not) and limits the number of returns to only 1. At half the current price, the product would be expensive. Now the cost is outright obscene. I couldn't possibly recommend TurboTax anymore.

This was a much better deal. There was a little glitch down loading it because you need a amazon pre program to get this to download properly, but once that was downloaded everything went smoothly. Another reason for my rating is the program directly using the net, turbo lost my info. This caused an additional three hours of redoing my tax info. With this download the info was always on my computer not all on the net thus little chance of loss. After the info was accepted by the fed and the state I downloaded the info to a storage devise and erased it from my computer. this will prevent hackers the ability to retrieve this info should I be hacked."

When I contemplated self-employment, I had several concerns, including whether or not I could actually keep the wolf from the door that way, but my largest was the thought that I would have to keep records of some kind. I don't have a talent for that. When my sixth client sent me a contract, I searched diligently for a book called, say, ""The Smallest Amount of Accounting Knowledge You Need to Avoid Getting Thrown in Jail,"" but didn't find such a thing. All the books I could find seemed to imagine that I was -- well, an accountant.
Office Accounting Professional 2008 doesn't assume this. It is bossy software.
You know what I mean about bossy software. It reminds you to apply payments to invoices and nags you about putting in people's names correctly and won't let you charge people for ""June.""
In general, I don't like bossy software. Bossy word processing programs often just don't understand complex syntax and don't have as large a vocabulary as I do, and I really don't need my computer to warn me that I haven't been properly introduced to websites.
But the bossiness of this software means that someone like me can put her data in correctly enough to send it off to the accountant -- and there is a system for doing that, too.
I scoffed at the set-up poster, by the way, but it was nice to have some large paper showing all the steps in order. I had no trouble getting the software installed, everything was done by wizards, and overall I found the whole package reassuring.
Now, I have no employees, and I have no interest in eBay, so I sympathize with those who felt that there were more parts to this than they needed. However, I found that this package has just the amount of power I need for keeping track of hours, jobs, clients, income, and expenditure. If I have employees some day, I won't have to learn new software. I can foresee needing to use the banking features, so I'm glad they're there. The extra features don't hamper my use of what I currently need, and I've had the experience before of spending more on trading up than I would have if I'd bought something more powerful to begin with.
I would strongly recommend this package for small businesses."

1,"You can always depend on Norton to protect your computer system, but you can't depend on the Norton company to protect your pocketbook! You can save 2/3 off the price by buying from Amazon or one of it's many suppliers. I buy my Norton subscription through Amazon every year and save a huge bundle!!"
1,"I started using CorelDRAW on a Mac 512, back in the late '80s, as an improvement over MacDraw.  As the years went by, the reality is that most of the world is on PCs, not Macs.  I wasn't doing enough graphics work to justify a good package, so I made a lot of graphics with Visio, PowerPoint, or (eeeek!) ""Paint"".  Finally, I moved up to Adobe PhotoShop -- What a headache!!!  It took a week's worth of classes to learn how to use the daggone thing!

Remembering how much better CorelDRAW was on the old Macs, I was eager to try this -- and I am NOT disappointed!  I have been using the PhotoPaint part of this package a lot, and it is - relatively speaking - intuitive to learn and easy to use.  Now, no graphics beginner is going to say that -- it's still a complicated package, but for someone with a decent graphics background (though by no means an expert), it's straightforward.  I have used the help file to find things, but once I find them, they are intuitive to use - I need the help file, but not a textbook or a class to teach me what the help file means!

PhotoPaint is POWERFUL, yet fairly direct.  A HUGE improvement over Adobe PhotoShop.  I would definitely choose Corel over Adobe here.  The products are a significant investment, though, so I would weigh how much I'm doing graphics before spending to upgrade to Corel, if I already had PhotoShop.  However, for any new ""seats"", licenses, computers, etc., I would definitely go Corel.

I also used the CorelDRAW part of the package, and for how I use vector graphics, it may be a little better than Visio or PowerPoint, but not a big difference.  I might choose it over the others, but I wouldn't bother with the expense to upgrade to it.

Note:  The Suite also includes ""Trace"" and ""Capture"", but I haven't used these, so I can't review them."

So far, it hasn't bitten me back and I'm slowly learning the curve of the program without being angry or annoyed.

Installation was very easy. No issues installing it to my Windows 10 PC. I also like that they made registering the product relatively fuss free. In addition to the program, when you register the product, you get additional online bonuses like 20GB of cloud storage and access to extra online content.

I've barely scratched the surface of Cyberlink's Power Director's ability. In my novice fumblings, I've played with the wizard features to help me quickly create an attractive format for my video. The program can utilize both photo and video media files to create your own movie.

When you're ready to publish, you have a choice of formats to choose from. The program also has quick settings for different device and different online services. I can upload directly to YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, Daily Motion, and others. The process went quite fast for me. Once I created my 3 minute short video in an HD format, it was rendered in a short time. The uploading to Facebook actually took longer than rendering, but it did upload properly and was available quickly.

What got me annoyed so far, when I use the Wizard help, some of the photos were cropped too tight. Even with the special effects zooming out or similar, the majority of the photos in my video were cropped much closer than needed to. Lots of good parts of my photos ended up getting cropped out. Other than than, it still managed to make a great video out of my photographs.

Once you start poking around in PowerDirector, you'll find new, cool, different, techie features that get your imagination going. You can create 3D movies, have 4K resolution, precision motion tracking, and more. It's all rather exciting.

It's a cool program. It has its quirks with the Wizard feature but still manages to create enjoyable movies to watch."
1,"This review is on upgrading from Quicken 2013 to 2014. I'm long time Quicken user and update annually. My large (>120MB) data file (>250,000 items and transactions going back to 1995) converted without any problems and my financial institution connections worked as they did before.  There is currently a R2 update patch available.

Didn't notice many visible UI or large feature changes from 2013.  Some of the dialog boxes (such as the One Step Update) are different.  However I did notice very good UI performance improvements in scrolling in the Portfolio View with investments (eg mutual funds) that contain many (100+) transactions.  Scrolling was painfully slow previously.  I understand Quicken 2014 uses an updated .NET software framework improves refresh performance.  I would recommend updating from 2013 to 2014.

Quicken gets a lots negative reviews.  Some of this is likely deserving - releasing 12 patches for Quicken 2013 in a year does not instill quality software development and testing practices.  Some of this is related to the very large user base with varying degrees of computer knowledge, condition of the user computers, and connectivity to a myriad of financial institutions, which Quicken gets the blame for the  problems.

My experience in using Quicken is not representative as portrayed by the severity of the negative product reviews and their support personnel.  I use Quicken extensively for my personal finances, tracking expenses, electronic bill pay via Quicken BillPay, and investments, making use of its online capabilities to send/update transactions, that I couldn't do without it. (My most used application after Office, browser, and email client.)  The Quicken community forum is pretty active and helpful in resolving problems.  I have had Quicken hang-up, crash, but I have not lost data, nor have erroneous balances or mishaps in any electronic payments.

With the shift to cloud-computing and mobile devices, there are a number of alternatives to Quicken like mint.com (also owned by Quicken's parent company, Intuit), or financial institution online services.  Some of these alternatives may be suitable to you depending on your needs.  I have not found any alternatives which provide the personal finance management capabilities as Quicken.

I hope Intuit management is paying serious attention to the negative publicity and addressing these issues as I would like see Intuit continue to have the revenue stream to be able to invest in developing and enhancing the product.

**11/21/2013 Update: Have used Quicken 2014 now for two months.  (System:  Windows 7 Professional 64-bit on a laptop with a 3rd generation i7 processor, 8GB RAM.  I keep my O/S and drivers updated to the latest releases.)  A R3 patch for Quicken 2014 is available.  In reading many of the amazon reviews, it's hard for me to imagine that I am using the same software.  My overall experience with Quicken 2014 has been positive. It has worked like Quicken 2013 with some performance improvements and generally stable/faster downloads (several financial institutions and many securities quotes).  I only experienced one crash and it was during a R3 patch installation.  No data loss due to crash.  I don't use the mobile feature (due to the reviews and no support for investments) or Windows 8 - which appears to be the root of some of the reported problems.  Quicken 2014 billing/reminder feature is useful.  It addresses the transaction copy/paste I used to perform to create a future income/expense view in an account register.  One issue I noticed is that you cannot switch applications when running the One Step update.  In other words you can't let the One Step update run in the background and work in another application.  Quicken returns the focus to itself.  Reading the Quicken forum, this is a known issue and hopefully will be addressed in near future. Also enabled mouse pointer trails which improved transaction entry speed.**

**12/4/2013 Update:  R4 patch appears to have fixed the ability to switch applications during One Step update.**

**2/14/2014 Update:  R6 patch was released in February.**

**3/12/2014 Update:  R7 patch released.**"
-1,"If ths following is your idea of good product support, then by all means, purchase Turbo Tax.  While using the software, I had no idea that this limitation to Turbo Tax existed.  As for me, my next purchase will be Tax Cut.

The only provision for claiming excess railroad retirement tax on Form 1040 is for tier 1 withholding. The excess can be derived from a combination of railroad employers or in connection with a railroad and non-railroad employer. The program does properly record the excess of the tier 1 tax on line 67 Form 1040 as a credit against income taxes. It does nothing with the tier 2 excess tax. This must claimed separately, as you noted in your email, on form 843 which is not supported by the Turbo Tax software.

The software's help does contain information regarding tier 1 and 2 railroad retirement withholding. The help clearly indicates that only tier 1 may be claimed as a credit against current year income taxes. It goes on to state, ""You cannot claim a refund for excess tier 2 RRTA tax on Form 1040. Instead use Form 843."""
0,"This voice recognition software is okay and may be pretty good if you take the time to teach it your words, dialect and manner of speaking. I have used it only sparingly and I find myself just typing more often.

For now I think it's okay but i may up my rating if I get this software to type faster than me without many mistakes.

Overall, this really can be a very helpful tool for those with limited typing skills or someone with arthritis or joint pains. In such a case, it's worth the time and effort to train this software to work well for you."
-1,"Is sad to know that the automatic map recognition in the firewall was removed in this Norton version, in most cases the companies improves their software, but in this case Symantec loses this characteristic. Now is necessary know the MAC address of all the computers in the network, then you need to invest many hours take note and write in the Norton firewall, well I think that the computers should do part of my job, and what happen if you forget one MAC address? you still give access to unknown computers when you don't know someone else is looking or surfing your hard drive. Its a shame."
0.5,"TaxCut offers individuals a powerful option for preparing an income tax return that is relatively easy to use. TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law. The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers. It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting. This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great way to get your refunds faster. But if you owe money, there's not as much of an advantage.  Still, you get five free electronic filing so you might as well use one.  In the unlikely event that you plan to prepare more than five returns, make sure you use the e-file for the ones due a refund and file the ones with money due manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and it will save you the cost of the fees for the additional e-files.

The one negative for this program is that the publisher used to offer free e-filing for the state return as well as federal but has dropped that for the 2008 edition.  With a charge weighing in a whopping $19.95 for e-filing each state return, this is not a trivial fee.  I would recommend filing state returns manually unless you will receive a refund large enough to make getting the check a week or so faster worth that extra money.

Please note that this version covers both Federal and State returns. Most people will need both, but if you live in a state with no income tax then you'll want to look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2008-Premium-Federal-e-file/dp/B001HO6Q7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + e-file</a>&nbsp;for considerably less money.

If you don't itemize your deductions and have a very simple return, you might be better off preparing the forms manually on your own. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you have a return with major league complications, you should probably go to a good CPA. For everyone else, this is really a no-brainer. It's inexpensive, easy to use, and accurate. I've been using TaxCut for quite a few years and would not even consider giving it up."
1,"Turbo Tax came through nicely again for me this year.  No complaints.  Will probly use again next year unless TT makes some major mistake in delivery, pricing, performance, or what what."
1,"I have long been a fan of the free version of  PowerDVD.  My husband has hearing problems because he was born an extreme preemie.  So when we watch movies we HAVE to have subtitles to help out. PowerDVD is great in this regard; they have many different options in their menu for setting up subtitles, font, colors, you name it.

The biggest thing I like about this version is how the movies look. We usually rent ours from Netflix and the first time we put in a dvd I was amazed at the quality of the video. I am not a techie junkie but even I noticed the difference immediately.  The quality was so nice, and the only difference was going from Media Player/free Power DVD to this.  Definitely does great in that department.

I didn't run into the program taking over my computer; I think people running into that either have a different version of Windows or they blindly click every box during installation.

Some of the features are super nice too, like the android feature; being able to watch YouTube videos in it and still have all of the fast forward and other tools. VERY nice!

Overall, I would definitely recommend the product. Just keep a close eye on it while installing and make sure you keep your computer your own (honestly, you should do this with ANY program you install!!!!)"
1,I like it !! It has nice features like web administration and it works pretty well. Great Product for an awesome price.
1,Have used this software for years now. My whole family does. Find it doesn't take away from the computers performance. Have kept our computers virus free.
0.5,"I've used different copies of Quicken in the past.  Premiere 2004 and 2007 and Starter 2010.  So I am fairly experienced with Quicken and have always enjoyed their software.  Premiere 2012 delivers and I love the ease of use, even more easy that the previous 2007 that I had (although I haven't used it for quite a long time).  I love the ease of getting a look at all my credit cards, bank accounts and investment account at a glance, knowing right away where I stand financially.  Additionally it is extremely easy to see where you are spending all your money and where you can save by minimizing your spending in that problem area (alas, mine are books and games.  I really need to reduce this area).  I haven't used the Bills or Planning yet, and probably won't as I don't really use this for those purposes.

Also, I've seen a lot of reviewers complaining about ads and the fact that the software is only good for 3 years before Intuit shuts that version off.  In regards to the ads I can't say that I have found a single one, except for the Wells Fargo logo that appears when I run an update.  As for Intuit shutting down the software support I kind of agree to a certain extent.  If I buy something I want to be able to use it until I am done with it, not be forced out of using it in order to have to buy the current copy.  That being said after three years I am sure there are improvements that I wouldn't mind obtaining as well as design, both visually and mechanically, that would make the software easier to use.  Buying the software once every 3 years isn't so bad and I don't mind it.

The only con I have found, and this was a lot in the Starter edition and has only happened once so far in this edition, is that randomly the update won't update certain accounts.  Sometimes it goes for a few days to a week before it will finally update.  This is a little annoying to say the least, but it always seems to correct itself and go back live.  Besides the fact that this is essentially the only financial software available I would definitely recommend it.

4 stars."
0.5,"I've tried quite a few anti-virus programs, and have already been around the block with Kaspersky. The last version I tested, the 2010 version, caused serious slowdowns in my computer (a quad-core intel box with 4 GB of RAM) and I un-installed it forthwith.

With the latest version, though, Kaspersky seems to have made great progress. It has all the standard features (firewall, a/v, anti-spam, URL filtering), so in that sense it's much like other suites on the market. For specific performance in each section, I'd suggest hitting a dedicated test site though: they're set up to perform such comparisons.

As for usability, it's about speed and dependability (after, of course, I've reviewed those results) and this program has been as good as any in those respects. I've gotten no virii since installing (though to be honest I'm pretty careful about how I use my computer) and the ongoing protection seems not to slow anything down. The full scan takes longer than many, but that really doesn't need to take place that often. A secondary scan, the ""critical areas"" scan is much faster and there's only a very slight performance hit.

One feature I liked that the program offers is what they call a vulnerability scan. In this, the program looks at your third-party programs and reports and known vulnerabilities in THEM - which is a fantastic feature, and allows you to get a leg up on that sort of thing.

All in all, I'm quite content and have no reason to be uninstalling this version any time soon.

Highly recommended."
0.5,"I have been a Beta Tester for Turbo Tax for several years.  Every year it has been improved in all respects, however, this year (2007), I found difficulty in entering purchase dates for stock sales.  The program seems to handle ""sale dates"" well, but not ""purchase dates.""  Some purchase dates do not transfer well at all.  This is the only ""bug"" that I have ever found in the final year versions of Turbo Tax."
-0.5,"I used Quicken for at least 10 years, going back to around 1990.  I stopped using Quicken about 8 or 9 years ago, due to all the bugs.

Well, I needed something to track my investments.  I needed to know, if overall I was making a decent return.  I don't want it for banking, etc.  I tried Acemoney and Moneydance.  Both of those were unable to download a ""starting"" balance from my brokerage accounts.  So, I reluctantly went back to Quicken.

By default, Quicken sends your data to it's website.  Turned that off!

I have brokerage accounts with Fidelity and ETrade.  So, far it works ok with Fidelity.  I have my accounts set up for dividend reinvestments.  ETrade goes out to 6 decimal places.  Quicken goes out to 6 decimal places for balances, but only 3 for transactions.  What?!  So, every dividend re-investment ends up out of balance and it makes you put in a place holder transaction for those fractions.  Updating the original and deleting the placeholder is a big pain.

This was a bug 8 or 9 years ago.  Obviously they did not do a good job of testing this software.

If you have ETrade, I would recommend staying away from this product."
0.5,"I didn't have any major problems installing this software.  The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem.  I had NIS 2003 and was very happy with it; this new version really doesn't seem to offer a lot of exciting new features, seems merely the same as 2003 dressed-up to look like a new version.  Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.  I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.  If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.  Can't get easier than that!"
1,"Running a Dual Screen Mac Mini is a great way to work.  As a writer, actor and host, I need a lot of desktop space.  As a business owner, sadly I still need Quickbooks.  Lets face it, the Mac Version stinks.  So parallels fixes the problem.  It looks like I have a PC on the left screen and a Mac on the  right screen, and work is easy."
1,"This demo was a just in time program.  My youngest daughter was in a ballet recital but a few days before the recital she fell and cut open her head.  That left a nasty wound that the ballet instructor asked us to cover with a minimal band aid.  Needless to say, we could not find a band aid so we tried to brush her hair to the side to cover.  It worked a little but in all the pictures this larger than life cut showed up very prominent.

It just so happened that the software arrived the day before so I loaded it onto my MacBook Pro and without reading through the instructions started playing with the program to see what it could do.  It was very easy to load and I was up and running in about 10 minutes after registering.  I loaded in my pictures and began to work with them, consulting the 114 page user's guide as I was going through the pictures.

After two bad starts I figured out which aspect of the program fixed images and wiped away blemishes and such.  In about 5 minutes I had figured out how to remove the wound from the image and place exact skin tone right over the spot.  I touched it up with a brush feature and then went about brightening their eyes and whitening their teeth, both of which were very easy to figure out without using the guide.

The final product was fantastic and my wife an I can't be more pleased and out daughter loved looking at her image without the cut.  For a program to load, be up and running and finish in less than 30 minutes is wonderful.  The smart patch is what I used along with the eye fix and teeth whitening.  I then spent some time going over other aspects of the program, such as body shaping, coloration, sharpening and blending and have to say I am very, very impressed with this software.

It will certainly be my go to software of r my pictures when I need to edit, fill in, remove or clean up something taken digitally.  I highly recommend this software!"
1,Recommended for anti-virus and automatic back-up.  It works and buying the whole package from Amazon is cheaper than renewing through Symantec.  I didn't reload it.  Just used the code to renew for another year.  Will probably do the same next year.  Doesn't seem right that it's cheaper to buy the whole package from someone else than to renew but it is.  Go figure.
0.5,"Norton Security is the latest incarnation or replacement for Norton 360. Norton has revamped their retail security lineup with the home line simplified to pretty much Norton Security with or without backup.

This application comes with licensing for 5 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but probably not all. If you need more or want online backup you might consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-with-Backup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security with Backup</a>.

You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

Windows Setup:

Windows Installation was faster than with older versions of Norton and was pretty painless for me. I did have to restart my Windows 7 Pro desktop. The controls available are pretty basic and there are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. What is missing in this incarnation of Norton Security is the ability to white-list specific directories or files. This caused some consternation for me, but more on that near the end.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is less ""noisy"" than previous versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. Unlike previous versions of the retail product I didn't perceive my PC running noticeably slower with it in operation. This is a very good thing! The initial full scan turned up a couple of minor items missed by my previous antivirus, but none of these were active viruses. Instead they were inactive left over pieces of already removed viruses.

Application Compatibility Problems:

I use VirtualBox to run a virtual machine on this PC. When I installed Norton Security Virtualbox would not start my virtual machine instance. Virtual box seems to have problems with most recent Symantec antivirus products (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Small-Business/dp/B00JKZPTPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Small Business</a>). I was stuck until I upgraded VirtualBox to a version which is newer than the latest official release (as of Oct. 1, 2014). It was good I found a solution because this virtual machine is critical to my business. This was the only application compatibility problem I've come across so far.

Since then I found the settings for exclusions. It isn't on the security page reached via the advanced button as one might expect, but found from the small gear icon for settings at the top of the control panel. The exclusions are buried in this group of settings pages. Go to settings, antivirus, scans tab, to Exclusions/Low Risks and then finally items to exclude.

If you want an integrated on-line backup solution, you might want to consider getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-with-Backup/dp/B00MHZ71G2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security with Backup</a>&nbsp;that supports 10 devices and includes 25GB of online backup space. Windows 7 Pro has a very capable backup program that works well with USB or network drives as backup media. For the difference in price it might be well spent if you need online backup and/or more than 5 devices.

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is a disappointment to me. It has a few features which do not include any virus protection:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 4 a mile way from its actual location!!
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 10 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS support is pretty lame. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware, but I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:

This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other antivirus products used on this computer did not, and does not seem to slow things down. I had one application that had a problem, but nothing else. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple, but does not include some advanced controls like white listing of applications, files or folders. It is probably a good tradeoff for most home users.

Because it's a great product for most people, but I had an application problem and the IOS app is poor I'm giving it 4 stars.

I've made a correction and updated information about setting exclusions for scans. Thanks to Ruth in NM for her helpful comment leading to a more accurate review."
-1,"It's an all or nothing install.
You can't change the install path if you want to partition your drive or use a SSD in combination with a hard disk(SSD for OS hard disk for apps).
Very resource heavy,uses about 3 gigs of disk space for an install.
Plus they jacked the price up by 5 to 10% over 2013.

Stick with 2013 until they get this one together or just skip it."
0.5,"DO YOU NEED TO FILE STATE TAX? Make sure you get a state version if you do, or federal only if you don't.

This review is for TuboTax 2013 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.

TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 if not installed (Mac is only 360MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes. How inefficient we have become, bat at least HD space is cheap nowadays.

The system requirements specifically mention Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7/8 but not Windows 8.1. When I installed it on my Windows 8.1 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2014) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike a few years ago).

NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.

I will update this review as I continue to use the product.

Pros:
* Price includes federal E-File
* Overall, probably the best tax program there is
* Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+) (anyone even use XP 64-bit anyway?)
* Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7/8/8.1
* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition
* Claims that your return will be accurate, guaranteed* (with some fine print)

Cons:
* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?
* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets
* Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements
* I'm not happy with the reports I've read indicating saying that Intuit lobbies Congress to keep taxes overly complicated, presumably so they can make more money from sales of their tax software.

WARNING ABOUT THE ONLINE VERSION (DOES NOT APPLY TO DESKTOP VERSION):

* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule D and E in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Premier)
* Intuit has removed the ability to do Schedule C and F in TurboTax Online Deluxe (you need Home & Business)"
0.5,"I have been a Symantec/Norton customer for 15 years or so and never cared for early versions of ZA that I saw on other people's computers.  The free-after-rebate offer tempted me to give ZA a try ... and I have to say that overall, I'm much more pleased with it than Norton Internet Security 2006.

ZA's antispam feature beats Norton's hands-down - putting almost all spam and no good mails into the spam folder.  Norton only gets about half on my laptop.

ZA's firewall seems to have more control than Norton, certainly more information.  With any firewall, it is OK for geeks like me, but ordinary users probably will accidentally block something that shouldn't be and end up with system problems.  ZA and Norton need a better interface for Mom and Pop type users.  I like the amount of control and the detailed logs.

My main frustrations with ZA are:

1.  it seems to slow down the startup of every program.  I have turned off the feature to scan programs on startup, but it doesn't help.  System feels sluggish compared to the way it operated with Norton.

2.  I have a satellite internet connection shared with Windows Internet Connection Sharing.  It took almost an hour to track down the proper help information to find the advanced settings dialog to make the host and clients see each other properly.  As with other things, could be better documented.

0.5,"PhotoPlus X2 is a very good photo editor. It is operates in a similar manner to Photoshop in many aspects though it is not as powerful as CS3 or CS4.

PhotoPlus X2 is similar in features and power to Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate.  Both programs are more powerful than Photoshop Elements versions 6 or 7.  An additional bonus of PhotoPlus X2 not offered with Paint Shop Pro is compatibility with 3rd party Photoshop plugins.

Pros:

Basic editing such as color adjustment, sharpening, lens filters, cloning etc are easy to find and use.

Photo resizing is excellent - the best that I have seen!  (I am referring to taking a small photo and doubling it in size.  Most programs leave the photo in a fuzzy condition.  PhotoPlus X2 somehow doubles the photos with less fuzziness.)

The lens vignette function is really a nice feature to have.  If you use a polarized filter, often times the sky on one side of the photo will be much darker than the other side.  The lens vignette function largely eliminates this problem.

Cons:

The sharpen slider in the Quickfix studio works in chunks rather than in a linear fashion - 0,50 etc.  You must type in a sharpen amount in the box next to the slider and then sharpen in a linear fashion - 28,29,30,31 etc.  Serif verified this bug in Sept 08.

The makeover studio requires several steps similar to Adobe Photoshop - creation of editing masks.  Paintshop Pro Photo X2 Ultimate thankfully does not require the creation of masks to do makeover tasks.

All in all an excellent photo editor that will generally run quite nicely on older hardware - Pentium 4, 3ghz with 3gb of ram."
0.5,"I'm sure there are lots of new, convenient features in this latest OS and that I'll be discovering them little by little.  Like many Apple users, I keep buying the machines so I won't have to fool around with too many peripheral and cosmetic distractions.  Give me fast word processing and CD burning power and I'm happy.  One minor irritation with this program is the difficulty of seeing which programs are active and inactive.  Instead of a black triangle, Apple is going with a little white egg-shaped marker that either doesn't show much of the time or is simply washed out by the screen and dock design--a veritable ""house of mirrors"" reminding me of the climactic scene in Orson Welles' ""Lady from Shanghai.""  Apple Discussion Board advisors acknowledge the problem and have directed me to a site from which you can download your favorite dock design from a choice of hundreds.  The only problem is that the skimpy instructions plus the steep learning curve (be prepared to go 4-5 sub-folders deep, switching the contents of folders while keeping the ""wrong"" name on the original dock folder, typing in instructions on the terminal to ""Kill all docks,"" then uttering a prayer) all but gave me--a simple, machine-dependent, computer-illiterate Apple consumer--more than I could handle.  I wound up having to reinstall Leopard and am for the present simply ignoring the question of whether the unhelpful, spotless icons in the dock are representing an active or inactive program.  Hope Apple figures out how to really light up  those indicators for a later version--or simply carries the Leopard theme a bit further and gives us unmistakable dark black spots for active programs.

(Later)  I'm getting hung up far more frequently with Leopard than Tiger (which is still installed on my notebook computer)--necessitating annoying ""force quits"" of both iTunes and Safari.  Just installed Apple's latest upgrades, but the annoying ""eternally spinning wheel"" is still appearing when more than one window is open.  Thanks to the notebook, I can keep both systems going simultaneously, but so far the Tiger is winning the fight in this zoo-keeper's Apple domain."

1,"I purchased Sketch Book Pro specifically for doing initial (draft) sketches of network diagrams, flow-charts, and other telecom engineering work. In the past I've found most drawing programs to either be lacking in features or far too complex to learn and use for simple sketches. What I needed was a program that could allow me to do a mix of vector object placement and drawing as well as free-hand sketching (with a Wacom tablet). Having tried many programs (like Iluustrator and Corel) I found them to be geared towards artists and designers as well they should be. I had resorted to using Microsoft OneNote (which I still use for other purposes) for sketches.

Sketch Book Pro offers the simplicity of doodle/sketching with some of the finer features of a mature drawing application such as pressure sensitive support and controls,support for gestures, flexible placement of pallets, etc.

In addition to these benefits it is a very reasonable price compared to other products. I do not use the painting features, but the pencil, marker, and other features are perfect for sketching and initial concept work. Compared to doing a first draft in Visio, freehand sketching a network design with Sketch Book Pro and the Wacom takes about 1/8th of the time.

I also use it for whiteboarding with engineers using desktop sharing with presentation/conferencing software."

  Well, just add Norton Internet Security 2008!

  System boot-up times will be extended by a factor of two or three. Just the thing you want when starting up your computer - a nice long wait. A really long wait.

  And if that wasn't enough fun, wait until you launch your web browser. All those hours programmers spent trying to build fast response into their browser creations? Wasted effor. Norton Internet Security 2008 helps your browser pass away minute after minute after minute. You had no better use for your time anyway, did you? Norton Internet Security 2008 will slow your browser to a crawl.

  Norton Internet Security 2008 will interrrupt you at least twice a day (and generally more) with an intrusive pop-up that new updates have been downloaded and that you need to restart your computer. Oh, how nice: they five you an option of being reminded in 1, 12 or 24 hours - but apparently no option to set the update schedule or turn off the annoying pop-ups. Symanytec's program architects certainly think that the user is not only clueless, but their slave as well.

  Symantec has included a ""feature"" they call ""Identity Safe"". Every time you type in a password to a site it launches an annoying pop-up asking if you want to use ""Identity Safe"". You can click on the convenient ""Do not show this window again"" option a thousand times - and it will ignore you a thousand times. Norton Internet Security 2008 also grabs web browser tool bar space, but fortunately you can turn it off.

  Does the product work for its intended purpose? That I don't know yet. I didn't have any viruses on my machine before I installed Norton Internet Security 2008 and it hasn't reported any.

  Overall, Norton Internet Security 2008 slows down my computer to such an extent that I think it is unsuitable for its purpose. I'll be looking for a replacement.

0.5,"I built a family tree more than 20 years ago, the old fashioned way, on paper.

I based in on interviews with grandparents, parents and cousins. There was no internet database in those days, and documents were extremely difficult to come by.

Even a visit to Ellis Island did not produce information concerning the ship on which my paternal grandmother arrived, as a child, with her mother, my great grandmother.

But this program is useful in any case, to add to the tree, and put everything in one place. It certainly offers a vast improvement over the only other family tree program I'd seen before ---- something put out by the Mormon church, and gifted to me by an uncle in-law fascinated with family lineage, including mine.

1,"Rosetta Stone's language software is fantastic. Their total immersion approach makes it feel like a play along game instead of learning a language. I had a bit of French in college, but despite the fact that it was a beginning class, students were already expected to know some French. The software outclasses the traditional class. Setup is easy and you can select the options for your level to go at your own pace. Seeing the images with text and hearing the native speaker really does allow for faster learning and you do use your own native ability to learn to better effect. The new Audio Companion CDs are an excellent reinforcement. They make it so easy to load them into a CD player or an iPod. You never feel as pressured to learn the language. I have always wanted to learn French and am loving doing so. The software is nicely packaged with a Quick Start guide, User's Guide, application software and three levels of language for beginning, intermediate and advanced. There are also four CDs for each level for the Audio Companion and an included headset with microphone. It is pricey, but worth it. With regular practice you will become proficient and the software interface is very user friendly. I highly recommend Rosetta Stone and will stick with them for my language learning needs."
-1,"Quicken has abandoned the users of the Mac platform, so the users of the Mac platform should abandon Quicken.

Like most other people reviewing the product, I became accustomed to Quicken for Windows, and then sought a similar financial software title after switching to the Mac.  Despite the ""Quicken"" logo on the box, this is NOT a solution for my needs.

If you're going to spend this much money on financial software, it's safe to assume you need it to do more than provide you with a running total and colorful icons - you need it to track each transaction, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS, have robust budgeting features and flexible account / category creation / interaction.  Quicken Essentials for Mac does not fit the bill.

I found, and after a slight learning curve, have come to love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moneydance/dp/B00005A9VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moneydance</a>.  The software is no longer available from Amazon, but can be downloaded directly from the developer.  It's written in Java, so it's completely cross-platform (running exactly the same way on Mac, Windows, or if you swing that way, Linux).  It has almost all of the features of Quicken, with the exception of tight integration with TurboTax- you can download new transactions for all accounts with one button, it securely stores account passwords, it can track most every type of investment transaction (notable absences include not-yet-vested stock and option grants), it can print checks, and you can design as many budgets and reports as you need.  Plus, it's extensible, so you can download extensions that will allow you to export tax-relevant transactions to the TXF format (used by TurboTax), or perform a number of other useful features.

Finally, Moneydance absolutely CRUSHES Quicken when it comes to data freedom - it stores all your data in XML format, and can easily export data should you ever want to move back to Quicken (you know, if you're a masochist) or to any other financial title.  Anyone who's ever tried to extract a decade's worth of data from Quicken will be sure to appreciate this feature, and recognize the confidence the developer must have in his software if he doesn't feel compelled to trap you into using it (a la Intuit).

Since Intuit can't be bothered to write good financial software for the Mac, support developers that can.  Get Moneydance, and you won't regret it."

1,"I have had many versions of security on my PC over the years. They all pretty much do the same thing is my untrained opinion. I don't mess around with specialized settings or do ""advanced"" anything with the program. The sell for me is whether is slows down my computer and/or makes it's presence annoyingly known. Of all the ones I've tried, including McAfee, Norton, AVG and some others I can't think of at the moment, this was the best. We made the mistake of taking Norton this year because we could get it for free. Free wasn't worth it. Next time, we'll be buying Kaspersky again."
0.5,"When I am planning a trip, I enjoy planning out the route, calculating the costs, finding nearby sites and restaurants...all of which I was able to do with this software.  For someone who revels in details, Microsoft Streets & Trips allows me to do so much more than I ever could with the free online navigation sites.

I found the interface fairly easy to use and had no issues.  Unfortunately, I found the execution of the GPS while traveling to be cumbersome at best.  We used our 17"" laptop, which takes up a lot of space in the front seat of the car (and must be held by someone) and is therefore rather awkward.  When leaving the computer turned on, it gets hot, and the battery wears out...not great for extended travel.

I may have done better on my Asus Eee PC, but lack the external drive to run the installation CD.  Nevertheless, I see the benefit of the trip planning software (even without the GPS) and imagine that the GPS feature would work well as long as you have the space and power for your computer.

If simply for the fabulous functionality of the route-planning software, I recommend this to anyone who is planning a trip and seeking a highly-customizable travel route."

0.5,"I have a MacBook Pro and previously owned the MS Office 2004 edition.  When I first converted from a PC, I found myself stumbling around the 2004 applications looking for things.  The 2007 release of MS Office changed to a ""ribbon"" interface that is similar to the toolbar setup of MS 2008 for Mac.  It should make for a smoother transition for new MS Office for Mac users.  But besides that, the interface for 2008 is neater and more organized.  I've also found the performance to be much faster than the previous version, and not as prone to crashing.

At home, I use MS Office 2008 for Mac for editing and reviewing work files.  I also use the Excel to keep track of personal spreadsheets.  I find both of these very easy to use and love having the ability to have these programs on my Macintosh.  A student version of the program probably would have been sufficient for me based on my past use.  While I do not need the functionality at home, the stripping of the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) is an issue for some users that they should consider before upgrading.  There is also no Analysis Toolpak, which again is only a concern for higher-level users.

However, the Microsoft Project Gallery is a great new application that I did not have on my 2004 student version of the MS Office software.  You can create business cards, brochures, flyers, calendars, stationary, resumes, envelopes, labels, etc.  It's kind of like a bonus ""PrintShop"" being bundled with the software... but with some very professional - and also some fun, sleek -templates.  The 2008 version also adds Microsoft Exchange capability to the e-mail program Entourage - a huge plus for those who use Microsoft Outlook at work and what to sync their e-mail at home.

Overall, I highly recommend this product.  I would recommend that you research the differences between each version of MS Office 2008 for Mac prior to purchase.  This will ensure you are getting all the features you need.  If your budget allows, this version is great to give yourself some features that may take a while to grow into.  But once you do, you will be happy to have them."
-1,"I used the 2006 version and found no problems with it.  I have purchased the 2007 version and now I have no PCU speed.  I have tried everything on their support site to no avail.  I was getting flashbacks to the past NORTON products, when I clicked my mouse and the cursor would continue turning, with no computer response.  Once I removed this JUNK SOFTWARE, my computer ""magically"" returned to normal.  My days of using Trend Micro are over.

Also, if you are running a home network, be aware that the enclosed firewall does not automatically setup for you network printserver.  My second printer would not respond, and I received a print server error.  All the past firewalls I used had no problems (zone alarm, kaspersky, norton, CA, etc.), but this one would not work, even with support help.  I did notice with this one, that I had to reinstall all the software for the home network and print servers, for all my printers, after I uninstalled PC-Cillin 2007.

1,"The Netgear ProSAFE 8-port Gigabit Click Switch is a office-space networking game changer. The unique office-friendly design with integrated mounting and cable management are stand-out differentiators. This ""smart-switch"" has management capability appropriate for a office environment switch with power-saving electronics.

Design:
One of the first things that stands out on the ProSAFE Click switches is the form factor. The sleek dimensions clearly have the modular office environment in mind and can mount at many places in modular non-modular office environments.

The click mounting system makes mounting a snap - literally. The locking tab make secure mounting of the Click Switch to the base in any of 2 orientations.

The 8 port version has a sturdy plastic case in a silent fanless design. The 16 port model is also fanless, but has a durable metal case.

The 8 port model provides 2 convenient USB charging ports suitable for tablets and other high-charge USB applications.  The power budget is 15W for both and any one port limited to 10W. This makes it handy in offices and conference rooms making it convenient for tablets or phones to get a charge boost. I like this in my home office because it eliminates 2 power bricks from my power strip.

The interesting power connection can be plugged in to have the cable exit either in the same direction and the network cables or at 90 degrees to that out the long dimension. There is no ""power brick"" to clog up power strips - the power adapter is internal to the switch. Something I find a very desirable feature.

The included Velcro cables tie completes the picture of switch design by someone who was thinking about usability in the real world as much as moving bits and bytes.

Configuration:
I downloaded and installed the ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility from the Netgear support site. The configuration utility found the switch automagically making it super easy perform initial setup on the Click Switch. The intuitive process was easy and there are only a couple of things to setup unless you need advanced features.

' Set the IP address - I recommend setting either a static IP address or a DHCP reserved address (what I did in my firewall) so the switch will always be at the same IP address.
' Change the password - The default password is ""password"", so change it to something better!

The Click Switch also has a web based management interface that is very usable if you prefer that instead of the configuration utility. I do.

The advanced (and just nice) configurable features include:
' The port LEDs can be turned off so they are not distracting (Just nice and good for bedrooms too!)
' IEEE 802.1Q-or port-based VLANs are supported for segregated traffic (i.e. voip/data)
' Extensive QoS by WRR, strict priority, or both, Port-based QoS, IEEE 801.2p QoS, ToS QoS and DSCP based QoS. These are to help make sure time sensitive traffic gets priority (i.e. voip or video).
' Port by port Rate limiting
' Port by port link speed and flow control settings (including a ""disable"" setting to turn a port off if desired)
' Port by port Broadcast Filtering
' Port by port cable testing (good for a quick cable integrity check)
' Multicast control via IGMP snooping
' Port mirroring which connects two ports like a old school hub (good for troubleshooting or some monitoring)

Note: the 8 port model has no LAG (Link Aggregation Groups aka Trunking). The 16 port model has up to 2 LAG group which can be nice for devices with 2 LAN ports that support static LAG. NAS devices come to mind.

Most users will not need to mess with most of the advanced features.

Green Power Use:
The 8 port Click Switch uses a max of 20.1W of power including 15W of USB charging occurring at the same time. This means without someone charging their device power maxes out about 5W. With smart port power management most of the time power consumption should be less. Perhaps much less. This is less power than used to be common for unmanaged or ""dumb"" switches. The savings can add up if you have a bunch of these in your business.

Support:
I did not need to contact support with the 8 port Click switch, but while testing my 16 port model I did and got excellent support. Be sure to register your Click switch within 30 days of purchase and you'll get  a lifetime warranty for a little extra peace of mind.

Conclusions:
The Netgear ProSAFE 8-Port Gigabit Click Switch has game-changing office oriented design and usability in a silent package. It is a capable smart switch which has good management and important features. The advanced features can make it possible to reliably integrate time sensitive traffic in the same switch as NAS file sharing, isolate traffic via VLAN support and more.

The switch is wire-speed which means it can move traffic as fast as it can be pushed over the individual LAN cables. In my testing this is the case as with pretty much any modern smart and many ""dumb"" switches. Getting data through a switch has become pretty much a given these days.

I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years. Other manufacturers had more attractive solutions for my clients' needs. Not so with the Click Switch. Because Netgear has built a compelling product for office (and many other) environments with a fairly rich feature set and easily managed I'm giving it 5 stars.

I'll be placing these into my client environments as new switches are needed. Well done Netgear.

Hope this helps someone!"

KIS is simple to setup, has all the expected features of a full security suite and runs silently in the background. No system slow downs unless KIS is running a full scan along with several programs, browser windows active at the same time.

All my settings, dock, programs looked exactly the same.  Only after using it was I able to begin to see what had changed.  NOTE:  I currently have this installed on my Mac Mini only.  I want to wait several months before converting all my Macs to Snow Leopard.

The Good:

-- Start up and shut down is, as promised, faster.  Likewise, Safari is much faster than even the newest update installed on Leopard.  Most other programs run faster as well.  These speed differences are noticeable, so, if you are at all impatient, you might want to upgrade for this alone.
-- Microsoft Office 2004 AND 2008 both work as they did before the upgrade.  I use these programs frequently, and the fear that they wouldn't be compatible almost steered me away from Snow Leopard
-- Time Machine seems to be much more stable in Snow Leopard, and this is perhaps the biggest plus of upgrading.
-- Snow Leopard includes X-Code tools for developers.  I don't use these, so I can't comment except that they exist.
-- Expos is a wonderful tool once put in the Dock, although not all users will need or want this access.
-- Computers that currently run Tiger can upgrade, thus skipping an entire OS (Leopard).  If you haven't used Leopard, you'll notice a huge difference.
-- So far, I have not had any compatibility issues with the applications I use.  Adobe Photoshop Elements requires the installation of Rosetta, one of the optional elements, but, if you don't download it initially, the computer will prompt you to install.
-- The family pack can be installed on five computers, without having to enter long codes.  If you have two or more Macs, the price per machine is quite reasonable.

The Bad:

-- At first, I couldn't install because I didn't have enough space on the hard drive for Snow Leopard because of the presence of Leopard.  I had to get rid of some old videos and unwanted photos to make room.  Once installed, I had the space available to me again.  People who have lots of media on their computers will have a tougher time than those that have less content.
-- The difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard are small enough to make this a desirable but not necessary upgrade.  The difference is not dramatic -- not at all like the leap between Tiger and Leopard.  You'll have to weigh the cost against the benefits.
-- The claims of ""greater stability"" are difficult to test since the original Leopard is pretty darn stable on its own.

Because Snow Leopard is not a step backward, I recommend getting it if you plan to keep your current Mac for a while since future tweaks are often dependent on running the latest operating system.  Likewise, if you have a Mac purchased just before the release of Snow Leopard, you should take advantage of the ten dollar upgrade before it disappears.  Except for those who still run Tiger,other Mac owners will not miss much in this latest OS X.

1,I was smart this year and waited until Intuit put it on sale with Amazon.  That way the price is easier to take.
0.5,I got this version of Nero 2014 because I have owned Nero since version 1.  I had read a review that said that their were certain add-ins that installed and couldn't be uninstalled.  I read every popup that has been displayed and have had so such problems.  As for the product.  There are a number of new features one being video editing.  I worked with it for over an hour and found it to be mediocre at best.  This version is good but it basically does what the last versions have done.  I like Nero and use it but the older version was just as good with few add ins.  For the first time buyer I would say this is a really good program for making DVDs and BlueRay and the company has been around for awhile.  As far as customer service goes I can't say since I have never had to use it.  I use Windows 8.1 and had no problems with the way it acts using this operating system.
0,"I have been using the business product since 2010 and this is the first time that it has let me down.
Received notice from IRS that my 2014 return was not filed.
I have screenshots from TurboTax which shows it as having been submitted on 2/2/2014.
I never received a confirmation email from the product showing the returns acceptance by the IRS, now I know why... the product dropped the ball.
When I go back into the product and check the status of the return it shows ACCEPTED......it's a shame the IRS does not have the same point of view.
Called phone support to make them aware of the issue, estimated hold time 6 minutes, now at 45 minutes and still holding.  Unbelievable.
I LOVED and TRUSTED this product in the past....extremely disappointed this year =...I TRUSTED the product to do it right.
Now I need to resolve with the IRS what should have been a simple process and unbelievably simple return."

It has long since been eclipsed in popularity by Microsoft Word though. My go-to processor these days is Microsoft Word, but I have a couple PCs and like to have different programs and utilities.

Speaking of Microsoft, this edition of WordPerfect is compatible with Microsoft Office. Yes, it is! It's one of the nicest features in my opinion. WordPerfect Office supports over 60 file types. Users can open, edit, save and share the latest Microsoft Office formats, including Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Excel.

Ever open a PDF file and wished you could edit it? Guess what, WordPerfect Office has a wide range of PDF functionality built right into the suite. These PDF tools include PDF Import, Publish to PDF, PDF password protection and PDF/A support.

-0.5,"I tried Windows Vista Home Premium SP1 to see if it was worth upgrading my home XP machine to Vista. I just can't find any compelling reason to upgrade to Vista. I have I gig of memory in my home machine and with XP it runs fine. With Vista I have to turn off the Aero graphics due to limited memory on my machine. Once the Aero graphics are turned off the system runs close to the speed of XP but you loose the major feature upgrade of Vista which is the improved graphics.

I have a MCSE so I'm very familiar with Microsoft OS's but I just don't find Vista to be very intuitive. Seems to me that they put pretty front ends on the same interfaces that are running once you get through the new front ends on system preferences and configuration. I find it harder to move around Vista and find things, and I have given it a good chance to become familiar with but still find it non intuitive.

I've had issues with the wireless on Vista. Easy to connect to my linksys but the connection keeps falling off and and then adds a new connection with a new name to the wireless list. I have had no issues with XP or my Mac 10.5 on my linksys router. Not sure why Vista is struggling but it has become a pain to deal with, especially when someone non technical is using the laptop and I'm not home and the connection drops.

So, if you are an XP user I wouldn't waist the money on the upgrade. Stay with XP unless you are looking to purchase a new PC or laptop and then you will be stuck with Vista whether you like it or not."

0.5,"I have been playing Nancy Drew games for over two years and I've now played all seven.  ""Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake"" was not my favorite.  In fact, I feel that it could have been better in so many ways.  Don't get me wrong.  The Nancy Drew games series is great.  In each game, you, as Nancy Drew, gather clues, interview people, solve puzzles, explore secret passages, and find the culprits.  The games are engaging, fun, and even educational.  And they're fun for both kids and adults alike.  The first game in the series, ""Secrets Can Kill,"" was well-intentioned but the character graphics (and the fact that you had to switch back and forth between two CDs) left much to be desired.  However, after ""Secrets,"" the games began to significantly improve.  You would think, then, that by the seventh game, the games would be stellar.  Not true.  I think they peaked at game three (""Message in a Haunted Mansion"") and four (""Treasure in a Royal Tower"").  It's almost as if, by game seven, the designers/creators have run out of ideas.  I don't mean for the plots -- I mean for puzzles, for character's wisecracks, that sort of thing.  Things that move the game along and make it fun.  Most every puzzle in ""Ghost Dogs"" was eerily similar to a puzzle we've seen in a previous Nancy Drew game, the only exception being the one you have to play when Nancy is in peril toward the middle of the game (this is not a spoiler; in just about every Nancy Drew game, Nancy is in peril about halfway through the game.)  That puzzle was fun.  But the others could have been better.  Also, in each Nancy Drew game there is some sort of educational element.  You learn things as you go along, from books, computers, newspaper articles, or signs.  But in this game, there was a HUGE amount of information on parks on one single computer.  Most of this information wasn't even important to the game.  Why is it there?  Who's going to sit there and read it?  With all due respect, I was just slightly bored with ""Ghost Dogs.""  My last complaint (and I really don't mean to sound like a picky grouch; I love Nancy Drew, really, I do) is Nancy's personal data assistant that she carries with her now.  She puts all her clues in there.  She even carries maps around with her now!  One of the most fun things about the Nancy Drew games, for me, has been that you have to write down clues (on paper, in real life), trace maps, etc.  If I happen to not notice a clue in ""Ghost Dogs,"" well hey, Nancy (but I thought *I* was Nancy?) has already jotted it down for me.  And this was on the senior level!  I guess I could just NOT look at the PDA, but come on, it's too tempting.  Where's the challenge?  I really hope the next game will be better; from the promo, it looks very intriguing.  And I *do* have faith in the designers to make this next one a winner.  In conclusion, me just say this: if you've never played a Nancy Drew game before, you'd be safe to start with this one, since all the puzzle concepts would be new to you.  But it's not the best.  Still, if you're a Nancy Drew fan, it's still pretty amusing and so I give it 4 stars."

1,Great!
1,"I have used H&R Blocks tax program for many years and have always been happy with it.  This year is no exception.  It works great on my mac.  My taxes are complicated because I have rental properties (and in the past my own business as well)--but it makes preparing my taxes a breeze---and way cheaper than hiring someone.

You can choose to import data or enter all data manually.  I actually enter mine in manually as that is my preference.  (actually, to clarify, i import previous years taxes but manually enter w-2s, charitable contribution, rental income and expenses, etc)

This includes 5 free federal efiles (which isn't as good, in my opinion, as when it included 1 state and 1 federal).  The state program is included with this but if you want to efile you have to pay for that.

For anyone that has to pay state taxes in addition to federal, it is great to have the two programs.  Essentially, the state taxes are filled out by the time you get done with the federal--with the exception of a few questions that you have to answer.  You can always purchase the state later rather than getting them together, however, i have found that it is more expensive to do it that way.

If you haven't used tax software before or are new to this brand---it is super duper easy to use.  They have questions and you fill in the blanks.  You can get more information and help with any topic you need.  You can also get the actual publication information from the IRS.  Tax preparation may sound intimidating, but with a program like this it is very simple.

With H&R block you also get access to a tax advisor for free (for 1 issue)--which can be helpful and is an advantage of this vs. other brands.

In addition you get audit assistance with this if you efile--although hopefully you will never need it.

Even if you have difficult taxes, don't be scared to try this product before going to a professional.  You will most likely find that it is much easier than you think.  And H&R block offers a money back guarantee so you really have nothing to lose.

Updates are free and essentially automatic--it does ask you permission to update--but that is pretty much the extent of it.

For safety purposes I always back up my taxes to a CD AND load the tax software and my taxes on a second computer--perhaps a bit neurotic but i'd rather be safe.  It is extremely easy to do back ups.  Also, I have several years of taxes loaded onto my computer and when i switched from primarily PC's to primarily MACs i was able to transfer all of my taxes over without a problem or hassle.

Because you get 5 free efiles, you can do your friends taxes if you want to be nice.  I always register the product in my name but usually do 4 different returns.  You can also choose to print and file returns if you would like also.

Another feature I like is that i can do ""what if"" scenarios--i will go in and change numbers to see how it effects  my taxes so i can better estimate for future years.

H&R Block also will give you tips/warnings/suggestions if there are any red flags or errors on your return.

UPDATE:  as of 2/22 I have successfully efiled  3 federal and state returns.  i did not have any issues with efiling at all.  although, i realized i made an error earlier in this review because when i went to file, i realized you get audit support if you efile or paper file--as long as you used the program to help you on your taxes."
1,Good software
1,"The most remarkable thing about Snow Leopard is simply that it can be installed on a Mac running Tiger. You do not need to pay the money to buy the boxed set to upgrade if you never upgraded to Leopard. This means that you can upgrade a Tiger computer to Leopard using this disk. It is up to the user to determine if they have an ethical problem with that; Apple certainly knew that this was possible when they released the software: they understand and use DRM effectively and always have. The fact it is missing here tells me that they are primarily concerned with getting Snow Leopard unto as many computers as possible as fast as possible. I am sure part of that is the desire to have Snow Leopard outperform Windows 7 which debuts in October.

So what do you get with Snow Leopard? The answer is largely performance boosts, although many of those are not really applicable (yet) since few (virtually none) third party applications use the performance gains offered by Snow Leopard. Similar to Windows 7s ability to load share between CPU and GPU, many of the changes in Snow Leopard will take several years for developers to really start to use and write programs for.

Relying on 64-bit architecture through the entire OS, Snow Leopard is essentially an upgrade for the future: as developers write programs that take advantage of the new, higher ceiling, end users like you and I will benefit. For now, most of the performance increases are only applicable to Apple's own software. However, that's not to say these aren't nice or useful, and in some cases very impressive:

1) Opening large photos is faster in preview mode

2) Quicktime uses significantly less CPU on all Macs regardless of generation. Older Macs benefit the most with as much as 40% performance gains.

3) Time Machine backups take about 20% less time

4) Snow Leopard itself installs faster than Leopard

5) Boot times are faster with Snow Leopard by 5-10%; Shut down times are slightly faster as well.

6) File compression is also faster by 10-15%

(These are somewhat simplified. If you want the exact numbers you can find them online: Google ""Snow Leopard Performance"")

Of all of these, the performance increases afforded to older first generation Macbooks are the most significant. Breathing new life into older hardware isn't easy, especially not significant improvements. Snow Leopard manages to do just that and make even slower 1.6ghz MacBooks that much more useful.

Installation itself is a SNAP (did I mention it takes less time than Leopard?). I've already upgraded a MacBook and MacBook Pro, and installation was simple, fast, and easy. I plan to install Snow Leopard on another older Macbook later in the week and will upgrade this review once I have.

The few new visual tweaks are nice, but not the reason to upgrade. Better stacks is useful, as is the quickness of Finder, but overall I don't find myself blown away by the upgrade. This isn't an entirely new OS with a fantastic array of improvements, aside from the welcome and useful performance increases. That said, if you are a power user or just observant, you WILL NOTICE the speed increase, especially in Finder. I used to prefer Google Desktop search on PCs to Finder, but this upgrade has swayed me to prefer Finder.

*****UPDATE September 2nd 2009*****

A few other changes of minor importance but sometimes great usefulness:

1) Air Port now shows all available wireless networks and their relative signal strength, something Windows has done going back to XP, but that for some strange reason has been absent from OSX 10. X until now. Now when you turn on the Air Port you get a drop down to select which wireless signal you want as well as signal strength.

2) The date has been added to the desktop. This isn't that amazing but it is useful.

3) I am LOVING the way stacks work now. They're so much more intuitive to use and navigate, especially the ability to brows through directories directly from the stack itself.

4) Trash has the ability to restore a file to it's original location right from the trash. This is a feature common to Windows that has been very strangely absent from Mac OS. It's nice to see them catch this omission and correct it, but very odd it took this long to do it.

A MAJOR complaint:

1) Seriously, no support for CS3? Why Apple, why? I don't have the grand to drop on the newest version of CS. This is very, very frustrating, and makes me wish I could take back a star and downgrade this to a 4-star review. CS3 is still so widely used that I'm amazed Apple decided not to offer support for it. If you want to continue to receive support for CS3 or don't have the money to upgrade to CS4, this could be a big deal and even a reason not to upgrade.

A Minor complaint:

1) One of my time machine back-ups for a co-workers Mac was seemingly corrupted by the upgrade. Fortunately they didn't have any old data they needed from that backup so I just made a new one with Snow Leopard that mounts just fine, but this is something to be aware of. If you have a critical time machine backup that you cannot afford to lose, I'd suggest making a backup of the entire drive (clone it) using SuperDuper! or something like it.

*****End of update*****

Snow Leopard will grow in usefulness as time passes. As I said earlier, once third party applications start to be written to take advantage of advancements in the OS, the performance overhead will become more and more useful. Expect to wait 6-12 months for that to happen, but in the mean time at least you're enjoying speedier OS performance for an very inexpensive price!"

I knew Trend Micro from 8 or 9 years ago when I got to know it as a free online system scanner.  I used it several times to rid myself of pesky viruses that McAfee could not deal with.

The specific thing I like about the Trend Micro is that it really doesn't slow the system down at all, while providing apparently great protection (I've had no virus problems that I'm aware of).  Some antivirus programs I've used really slow the computer down and make looking at pages on the Internet a drag.  But the Trend Micro has been almost invisible.

I have been very happy with the feature whereby it clears out the malicious cookies that are downloaded onto my computer through surfing the Internet.  Each day it deletes spybots and data miners without my prompting it.

-1,"Have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for years, but this year Intuit decided to omit several forms in the Deluxe version and now charge an extra $30.00 just because these forms are now part of Turbo Tax Home & Business.  So much for customer appreciation and repeat users.  The program itself is good and installs easily.  Transfers are easy too.  Be careful however when installing because the program asks where you want to store your tax document--My Documents or Encrypted.  I first choose to store in My Documents--that received a pop-up stating this was risky and was I sure I wanted to do this.  I decided perhaps the files should be encrypted and filled out the necessary information to create an account on Intuit's web site.  Account created.  Then I saw the light so to speak.  Next year I will have to buy Turbo Tax again if I want to transfer my tax data.  I haven't found a way to save this year's return both on my computer and Intuit's Web site.  Uninstalling the program and reinstalling it still forces one to use Intuit's site.  The option to store in My Documents doesn't exist once you create an on line account to store your return.  Yes, this was my fault for creating an on line account, but there is an element of again taking advantage of the customer on the part of Intuit."

0.5,"I've been using Adobe Creative Suite applications since some of them were Macromedia applications, but I never really got up to speed on Flash. So I had high hopes for this product.

The videos do a good job of presenting the various components of Adobe Flash. The format is largely voice-over and animated screenshot (with optional captions for the voice-over), so you can actually see the features in action as they are being described. There is also an option to watch-and-work, which puts the video into a smaller side window, so you use your own Flash to follow along (appropriate files are included). This is great,  but much more usable on a larger screen. There is also a feature that lets you offload the videos to an iPhone or such, but I didn't try that.

Even better for us non-newbies, however, is that the videos are arranged like well-written software documentation - chapters are topic-specific, and there are headings and subheadings within the chapters, with easy navigation between them, (I really didn't need to see how to use the eyedropper tool, for example, but had no trouble skipping right to the explanation of tweening).

The included booklet has smattering of coverage of additional topics of interest (copyright, project management, design), and then sections on what's new in Flash 5 and Flash basics. At the back of the booklet are several pages with lists of keyboard shortcuts - these will get xeroxed and used to excess, and I would be in even deeper ecstasy if they had come in the form of printed glossy cardstock.

My only beef with this product is an odd bug that kept cropping up when I was using it with my Fujitsu Lifebook - the video player interface has a top navigation menu, which worked fine on my Macbook Pro, but the menu kept disappearing on the Fujitsu (perhaps because the screen is only 8""x10"", perhaps it's a Mac/PC thing). This was mostly a minor annoyance, but when I popped up the help screen (using the F1 key) there was no way to get back out and back to the video. Annoying but avoidable.

Overall, this video series is recommended for anyone who wants to get painlessly up to speed in Flash."
1,"I used TurboTax Deluxe 2013 to calculate my anticipated tax burden and potential refund the day after receiving my last paycheck of 2013 (of course I will re-evaluate it once we get our actual W2s). If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.

I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.

What I also like, is switching back and forth between the ""hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.

Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. Or, if you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, maybe the cheapest basic one is all you need!

If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.

FYI: The IRS will not process returns in 2014 for tax year 2013 until after January 31st, so don't feel too rushed to buy this and file immediately, as you will still need to wait until *at least* February for any possible refund."

I was looking forward to 11 not for all the fluff that Companies that use to sell these days (3D, Control with your iPAD) I was more interested in the 7.1 sound.  The 7.1 option is not normally available in the free versions that come with your Bluray drive.

The interface is crowded with a bunch of other junk.  You need to go through all the settings to get it some what usable. After I got the player working the way wanted to, I have some problems with the software freezing on some Blurays.  My Computer setup is Win7 X64, I7-2600K, 16GB RAM, and a SSD so I know it is not my setup.  The Blurays also play fine in my regular bluray player

I have since stopped using the software because of the frustration and cannot recommend to purchase the program.  When you buy a bluray drive make sure  it comes with software

I gave it two stars because it does play most blurays"
1,Received as expected
1,great product
1,"I had been using Turbo Tax for many years, then last year I tried Tax Cut.  I made a mistake in buying that program and thank goodness they honored their refund.  I had to buy Turbo Tax Deluxe anyway.  I am purchasing the Basic this year because I don't have to file State taxes anymore.  The Deluxe program was great I hope I don't get disappointed in the Basic.  For the price, I don't believe this program can be beat."
1,Working great and good price
1,"No problems at all.  I have had dragon for mac and dragon for PC.  I got this product for free -- and probably wouldn't have bought it, because the older versions worked, but were klunky.
This is a better version, and I use it on my desktop MAC.  I took off my headphones and set them on the desk, had a phone conversation on my cell -- ooops, my whole conversation was transcribed!
It works well, no problems.  I only use it to ""write text"" into word; I find it easier to just point and click to do other things.  No complaints, even with the Mac version.  It is worth the purchase."
1,"I used TurboTax Deluxe 2013 to calculate my anticipated tax burden and potential refund the day after receiving my last paycheck of 2013 (of course I will re-evaluate it once we get our actual W2s). If you filed last year with TurboTax 2012, yes, it is basically the exact same program. But the behind-the-scenes stuff gets updated with new forms and tax laws, etc. I'm sure all of that costs plenty to keep up with, justifying having to re-buy what seems like the same program every year. Though it does beg the question, could we maybe just buy a single TurboTax and pay each year just for the updates and to e-file, instead of re-buying nearly identical software, and a new box and disc and updated marketing, etc. But I digress.

I file Married Filing Jointly and have a pretty simple tax situation (wife and I each have one job, no kids, standard deduction). And for this purpose it was EXTREMELY easy and simple to file. I've used TurboTax since 2011, and I really like how it imports the previous year and unless anything major has changed, you basically just swap some numbers around and you are DONE! I probably spent less than 10 minutes importing my 2012 return and updating it for 2013. Since I've used TurboTax for the last 3 years, it also shows you a tax history with your history of income and taxes. It's kind of fun to see a trendline over the years, especially if it is (hopefully) in the upward direction.

What I also like, is switching back and forth between the ""hold my hand' version of the software and the raw tax forms. Some of the questions and situations TurboTax asks me about, I am curious what actual tax basis there is to the question. So after I fill it out, I switch to the forms and see exactly which fields on which forms are being populated based on my answers. It can help you understand tax filing much better to actually look at all the forms being submitted rather than relying solely on the user-friendly walkthrough version. But if that stuff doesn't interest you, it seems accurate and reliable enough to not really need to fret too much over it either.

Make sure you look at the difference between the TurboTax versions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, Home & Business) so you don't leave tax deductions/credits on the table. Deluxe was what I needed, but depending on your situation it may benefit you to pay a little extra for the pricier ones. If you have a pretty simple tax situation and could file a 1040EZ, the cheapest basic one could be all you need. If you are self-employed, own a business, trade stocks, I would look into the Premier or Home & Business options.

If you are new to TurboTax and will not have anything to import from last year, it takes a little longer, but it is still pretty quick to enter everything in. I could maybe do mine from scratch in 20 minutes. Granted, many people have all kinds of deductions and credits or self-employment details (or if you bought/sold real estate or stocks etc.) that could drastically lengthen the time it takes to go through the process. But all I know, is for me personally, this product is simple, thorough, and exactly what I needed. I fully intend to purchase TurboTax again next tax year.

0.5,"Mavis Beacon is back with a new edition, and she is still as relevant as ever.  I got this for my first and third graders to learn how to type.  The third grader has had a few basic lessons at school, and this program is working well with what he's doing there.  He already knew the ""home keys"", and so the lessons on learning the letters that go with the fingers were perfect for him.  He was already doing some of that, so MB is great reinforcement and extra practice for him.  He is improving steadily, and is starting to use proper form when using the computer.

The first grader on the other hand, has never had any typing lessons before.  The concept of the home keys is new to him, and it isn't really emphasized very much by MB.  He rushed through to get to the actual typing lessons, but was just using whichever fingers were easy for him to do *fast*, so I stopped him.  We'll try it again in another year or so - I think he's just too young for this particular program.  So, the ""ages 8 to adult"" on the package is probably right on target!

All in all, Mavis is as good as ever, and teaching a skill that is critical to life in the world today.  Some other comments, off the top of my head:
- This program has audio - just about everything is read aloud.  Unfortunately, on my computer (not the fastest), the audio lagged a little bit, and isn't as helpful as it could be.
- The videos that show you what each lesson is about - seem to be there just so they can say they have videos, because they really are just showing the lesson.  Watch the video, do the lesson, same difference!
- And one suggestion for future versions of the program: make more lessons for speed building!  I've been typing for years, but I still top out in the 40s.  I would love to get faster, but I seem to be stuck."
0.5,It works as advertised.  I have both MAC and PC platforms and for MAC there are cheaper solutions available that do the same things.  MAC is a greeat platform for open source apps.  IF you want total compatibility with PC Word and other Office suite products then this product should be your choice.
1,"I am a big fan of Turbotax, and have been for many years.  I find their products very ""intuitive"" to use, and the question-and-response method of entering tax data is very useful to me.  What's more, I like the fact that they offer different versions of the software for different tax situations.  I have used many versions, but this year again, the Premier edition is perfect for my situation, with some stock action to report, as well as rental income.  (P.S.  Their small business and self-employed version is great, too, and helped my self-employed wife for many years accurately report income, in order to get social security credit, and properly file.)

Lots of people complain about TurboTax each year, but I think you will see, the overwhelming amount of reviews are positive.

For over 10 years now, TurboTax has helped us quickly, accurately, and easily file our taxes.  Simply go through each section (income, deductions, credits, etc.), answering each question as it pertains to you.  Voila!  Any credits you are due are credited, any deductions, too.  It will tell you if you're better off taking the standard deduction, or itemizing.

Filing is a piece of cake.  It lets you electronically transmit your data to the IRS, and saves a .pdf file of your return for you, every single form needed.  Refunds are processed quickly, within a week to 10 days has been my experience.

I highly recommend this product if you have investment income/losses to report, as well as rental property.  If not, simply go to their website, or look on amazon, and find the version that is right for you.  They offer 4 different versions to cover individual situations."
1,Works well for PC's that are not equipped with Bluetooth. Plug & Play on Windows products.
0,"I installed Microsoft Streets and Trips on my ASUS Eee PC 1000HE netbook.
Software installed easily and quickly using an external DVD drive.  The computer recognized the GPS unit, however it could not find any satellites (in comparison the Garmin sitting next to it was finding 10 satellites).

I contacted Microsoft and through remote access the tech did the following. I asked him to send it in an email to me so I could provide it here.
*******
Following are the steps we did

Step 1: Click on START and then click on RUN. In the RUN box, type MSCONFIG and click on OK.

Step 2: Under System Configuration, click on Selective Startup, and uncheck the following items...

Process System.ini file
Process Win.ini file
Load Startup Items

Then click on the tab SERVICES and check the option - Hide all Microsoft Services. Then click on DISABLE ALL and the click on APPLY and CLOSE.

When prompted to, restart the PC and try Streets and Trips with the GPS, it should work. Once it Starts working, repeat Step 1 above, and then switch back to Normal Startup, apply that change and click on CLOSE. That will get the computer back to normal. Now, try Streets and Trips with the GPS again, and it should be working, with the PC in normal mode.

********

Once this was done the GPS did pick up satellites.  However, when actually using it on the road the connection was dropped and picked up once every few minutes, then every time it would pick it up it would recalculate the trip again.  After speaking again to the tech he told me that it might be that the USB ports are not powered enough.  He got this information from another tech and sounded unsure about it.  I myself do not know if this is true.  Perhaps someone who does can comment on it.  I learned also from the tech that there are two different GPS units provided with this software.  I got a Navation GPS 168 with mine.
 The software is great and intuitive.  My 13 year old son quickly figured out how to use it.  Great for finding restaurants, gas stations ect. You do need someone else to run it, it would be dangerous to be making adjustments while driving yourself.
I am giving it 3 stars,  five stars for the software and one for the GPS receiver to average 3 overall.  The only downside I have found to the software is that sometimes it knows the street name (displays it on the map) but still calls it a ""local road"" when speaking directions.  I think it should work with a netbook, or if it does not they should tell you so in the description.  Tech support was very helpful and even called me back to see if it was still working a few days later.

****UPDATE

We bought a longer USB cord for the GPS so it could be right up in the windshield and now it works much better.  The cord supplied did not have a very tight connection and the short length made it hard to get it near a window.  I am upgrading it to two stars, since now it works pretty well but Microsoft should have sprung for a slightly better USB cord that holds the GPS securely and reaches far enough to go into the window."
0.5,"There is some fun stuff in this PC game; but overall it's kind of boring and a little bit annoying.  And I am a big fan of the Nancy Drew PC games!  I have a feeling the next game (available fall 2005), ""Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon"", will be longer and more mysterious!  My favorite ND games thus far: Danger on Deception Island, Secret of Shadow Ranch, & Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake."
0,"I recently re-installed this onto a home theater PC (HTPC) I built.  Previously I had written a largely negative review, but I'm putting in a new one now with some details about using this for HTPC.

1. DRM.  Using NetFlix with a TV means you have to have a direct HDCP-enabled connection from the computer to the TV if you're using HDMI to connect to the TV.  Putting a receiver in the middle of the mix breaks the HDCP stream and ""protected"" streams don't play.  You get a mysterious unhelpful ""DRM error"" instead of something useful.

2. When using this as a HTPC, I had to turn off ""super fetch"" and indexing and defragmenting.  Why does Windows defrag automatically?  There's really no reason to do this these days and it can result in data loss if disk blocks are moved over deleted files (i.e., you can no longer recover deleted files).

3. Software updates are just as annoying as they were with XP.  Come back to your computer to use it and find that it's been rebooted.  As a HTPC, this isn't a big deal--as a workstation it's a huge issue to me.  I just leave the updates on because of how I'm using the computer, but as a workstation I'd turn it off.

4. The Aero interface is pretty to look at.  Modern hardware as of late 2008 can handle it just fine.  I'm using a $140 motherboard w/ integrated ATI graphics and a $70 Pentium dual-core processor and everything is slick and fast.  Hardware has caught up with Vista.

So in summary, it's just another version of Windows.  It's prettier than XP, and if you turn off enough of the background stuff, it's more than usable with 2 GB of RAM without constantly accessing the hard drive."
-1,"Pros: good accounting program insofar as it works.

Cons: 1. will not update to send and download transactions and thus is useless as a online banking program.
  2. customer service is not competent to remedy the problem."

1,"Is you are coming back to the Corel Draw world because the Adobe Illustrator ""cloud"" software license ticked you off, we are here for the same reason. I used Corel Draw years ago but over time Illustrator became my primary vector tool. Their aren't many decent options for drawing Vector art and I;m glad that Corel has continued to improve their product. I'm quite impressed with version 7. The tabbed interface is responsive and easy to navigate.  They have multiple standard layouts like Illustrator too (Lite, Classic, Default, Illustration and Page Layout). The sheer amount of new features that Corel has added to bring Corel Draw within striking range of Adobe is extremely impressive."
1,Works on my old PPC Mac
1,Works Great I would buy this again
1,"this is the smaller version of quicken for home use.

I have used the other full version, and this one is perfect for home use.

since I don't keep a checkbook register (and don't write paperchecks) I download the info from my credit union and upload to Quicken. takes a few minutes a week and the checking account is balanced!

You can flag tax deductable items, and during the wonderful tax season, use that to double check your deductions, etc.

if you need to, it will give you charts on your spending."
-1,"I believe that Apple has made a serious mistake eliminating features from Imovie 08.  I was planning to switch to a Mac in November after OSX 10.5 was released.  I planned to switch for two reasons:

1.  Clean design - eliminate a lot of cables.

2.  Imovie - I currently do quite a bit of video editing for my church on my Dell 4600 using Pinnacle Studio 9.35.  Pinnacle Studio's interface essentially is a knock off of the old imovie 6.  Very easy to use.  However, Pinnacle is buggy and unreliable!

Imovie 6 is about 80% as powerful as Pinnacle Studio. Unfortunately, I wrongly assumed that the next edition of Imovie would be more powerful than Imovie 6.  Therefore, I have been waiting for over six months for the new Imovie to be released before I purchased a new Imac extreme edition.  Now I see that one of the major reasons for purchasing a new Imac has been removed.

Final Cut Express to me is a difficult and frustrating product to use.  (No automatic segmentation of imported video clips, no storyboard mode.)  If I am stuck with Final Cut Express I might as well keep my PC and buy Sony Vegas.  (It does not have a storyboard mode but at least it does segment video clips).

I sincerely hope that Apple reconsiders Imovie 08 and releases a true competitor to Pinnacle Studio or Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum.  As of right now the PC has the lead in mid level video editors when it comes to ease of use.  This should not be!

I don't think that Apple understands what a selling point Imovie was.  I have had several clients buy Macs in the last year and almost all of them wanted to play with Imovie.  These clients are not sophisticated users, yet they figured out Imovie in a matter of minutes and have been producing nice movies now for several months.  They have been eagerly awaiting the new Imovie because they were looking for more features.  Sadly they will be disappointed.  Some may be forced to run Pinnacle  Studio within bootcamp.  Not exactly what I or they had in mind!"
1,"I needed some simple switches not too long ago to place in low volume traffic areas.  A prime concern was price, and these fit the bill quite nicely.

Although there are only three connections to the switches that I placed, they are expected to handle some rather large transfers at times - they are connected to networked printers in the premises, as well as to a networked copy controller.  I have not seen any issues with them since their installation, and they look decent enough to not cause any raised eyebrows when they are in plain sight.  Time will obviously tell how well they last, but considering that a similarly placed ""name brand"" switch recently gave up the ghost after 8 months, these have more than paid for themselves by now."
1,good
1,"Super for home or business networks.
In addition to this eight port, I also have the 16 port that i run my office with. The design and mounting of these switches is great looking and functional. First switch to ever look cool. Power supply is built in so there is no power brick / wall wart.
Simple to mount. Simple to setup. And simple to manage with software (windows only)'or direct IP address of switch through any browser.
You will be impressed."
